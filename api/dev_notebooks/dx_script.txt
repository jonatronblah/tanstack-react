UNATCO TRAINING COURSE

UNATCO TRAINING FACILITIES - CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES

JAIME REYES
I figured you'd be sick of drills by now. Hopefully our training exercises will
be more interesting than what they've had you doing at the Academy.
Open the door by clicking the right mouse button. The right button uses items in
the world.
The key on the desk opens encryption-based nanotech locks. When you pick it up,
it will automatically be added to your key ring. Use the key to unlock the door
and proceed to the next area.
You're going to get a lot of equipment during these exercises. Press F1 at any
time to access the Inventory Screen, which will let you add and remove items
from the Toolbelt. Press F2 to view your current goals and any notes you may
decide to take. On a typical mission, a UNATCO agent's objectives are logged
electronically so that he can stay on-task at all times.
Now pick up a weapon and try to break open those crates. One of them's
indestructible, but the other contain things you might find useful.
Now pick up the lockpick and use it to open the door. Lock-picking takes time
and expends the self-assembling resources of modern lockpicks. Just be patient
and remember your training. At higher skill levels, you won't need as much time
or lockpick resources to pick a lock.
Doors have two strength values. The Door Strength tells you how much damage a
door takes before being destroyed. The Lock Strength tells you how many
lockpicks will be required to pick the lock. Some doors have an infinite
strength and an infinite lock strength. That means you have to find a key.
The code to the door has been stored in that datacube. Right-click on the
datacube to read the contents, then type the code into the keypad. You activate
the keypad with the right mouse button, just like you activate a datacube or any
object in the world.

DATACUBE

We'll make this one easy for you. To open the door, use the code:
0012
Got it?

Use the disposable multitools on the table to hack the keypad up ahead. A
multitool's resouces are finite. When a tool is depleted, it becomes useless.
The manual describes other uses for the multitool. At higher skill levels,
you'll need less time and multitool resources to hack a given device.

BOOK

UNATCO TRAINING MANUAL
Section 3C: Multitools

A "multitool" is not really a tool at all -- not in the usual sense of the word
-- but a disposable electronic device that utilizes electromagnetic resonance
detection and frequency modulation to dynamically alter the flow of current
through almost any non-hardened circuitry. Skilled agents can use the multitool
to manipulate code locks, cameras, autogun turrets, alarms, or other security
elements.
Note that multitools CANNOT be used for computer information extraction (see
Section 5A: Hacking).

DATACUBE

Almost done, but one quick note:
I'm not exactly the expert on this sort of thing -- for that you'll have to
check in with Sam Carter when you get to Liberty Island -- but remember that
there's any number of other ways to open a door, including using explosives or
finding a security computer.
Jaime

CONVERSATION: UNATCO TROOP

UNATCO TROOP
I'm here to pick up all munitions and equipment. Thanks for the cooperation,
Agent.
You aren't done yet...
Got you running the course, huh? Don't sweat it; everybody has to do it once,
even the special agents.
Carry on with the training, Agent. I'm just here to take care of your gear.
So far, so good...
This thing's a bitch, isn't it? Last time I did it... Man, I sprained my ankle
on the jumping part. They should get rid of crazy stuff like that. Someone'll
break their neck.
Hand in your equipment. That's right: no cheating.
You've got to start the next section without arms or tools. Rules are rules.

JAIME REYES
Lying in front of you is a brave cadet who volunteered to be rendered
unconscious for this next training exercise. Highlight and search him to find
the key to the medical room. Afterward, pick up his body and place it on the
medical table so that one of my aides can revive him once the exercise is over.
Good work. I'll get someone down there immediately to revive Private Winslow.
Move on to the next area.
You can bet this won't be the last time we send you into a dark room. Turn on
your light augmentation and find the exit on the other side. Just press F12, by
default.
You're not a mech, but you're enough of a machine to need repair bots now and
then. If you used up some bioelectric energy getting through the dark area, for
example, this contraption can charge you back up.
Congratulations, you completed Phase 1. Move over the ramp into the next rooms
to begin learning movement skills. We'll be watching you through the cameras,
like the one you can see up in the corner. In the field, remember that
terrorists sometimes use cameras like this in their security-grids to set off
alarms and alert guards to your location.
Jump across the platforms. You'll have to crouch to get under those pipes. If
you fall use the stairs to begin again.
You need to go through the door up ahead, but it's blocked. Those wooden crates
are too big to jump and too heavy to lift, so use the metal crates near the wall
to build steps. To pick up a crate, walk up to it so that it highlights, then
click the right mouse button. To drop something you're holding, you can press
the Tab key by default.
Now go up the ladder at the other end of the room. By default, you look up and
use the arrow keys to climb.
We get some complaints about this swimming obstacle because the water's
contaminated. Recruits forget to grab the HazMat suit and end up in my office.
Not pretty. Or they forget that they have to put the suit on by selecting it and
pressing the left mouse button. Remember that the HazMat is disposable; you can
wear it only once, and it operates only for a fixed duration. Use the ramp on
the other side of the pool to climb out.
These medical bots, normally used for quick-healing, are of particular interest
to you, JC, because you need a bot's help to install new augmentations. If you
took any damage during the swim, now's a good time to get patched up.

CONVERSATION: UNATCO TROOP

I'm here to pick up all munitions and equipment. Thanks for the cooperation,
Agent.

CONTACT: GUNTHER HERMANN

GUNTHER HERMANN
Welcome to the combat training area. I am Gunther Hermann and I will be
monitoring your progress here. We will start with weapon familiarization.
Your first exercise will be to learn a little about aiming and targeting. Step
up to the shooting range to the west.
The targets are released by using the buttons on the counter. Release the first
target and take a few shots with one of the pistols until it is destroyed.
Notice the targeting reticle appears when you aim at a target.
Good. If you hold your aim for a few seconds before firing you will notice the
reticle starts out wide and tightens as you hold. The longer you aim at the
target without moving the greater your accuracy will become. Release the second
target and aim before shooting this time.
Good work. Now proceed to the next area.
This is the rifle range. Here you will learn one of the ways skill level makes a
difference in your accuracy. Step up to the shooting range.
The targets are released by using the buttons on the counter. Release the first
target and destroy it with the rifle. Use the rifle's scope by pressing the left
bracket key "[" to turn the scope on.
Excellent. Now we are going to raise your skill with rifles to Master level.
Release the second target and destroy it.
Good work. As you can see, higher skills give you better range, accuracy, and
effectiveness. Proceed to the next area when you are ready.
This is the demolitions training area. First you will learn to use a LAM as a
proximity mine. Approach the bay window and you will see a LAM placed on the
target board on the black and red wall.
Press the first button next to the window and a security bot will be released.
Watch as he nears the LAM. LAMs placed on walls are proximity triggered.
This time you will place your own LAM. Take a LAM from the munitions bay and
proceed to the red and black wall below.
Get as close to the wall as possible when you place the LAM. If you aren't close
enough, the LAM will fall to the ground and detonate.
Very good, Agent Denton. You may proceed to the next area for more demolitions
training.

CONVERSATION: UNATCO TROOP

UNATCO TROOP
You'll need a few extra LAMs for the demolitions area. Here, catch!
I just like to kid around.
Gets boring down here.
Didn't have my boots polished. That's why they put me here.
They just make up excuses because they like to harass us.
This place would run a lot smoother if they'd just rotate assignments, instead
of always making you feel like you're being punished.
Bastards. I don't have to take this crap. There's lots of things I could be
doing.
I had offers on Wall Street, you know. Top corporate security divisions.
Corporate work's not so glamorous, but it sure pays better.
One of these days, I'm going to resign. Then they'll be sorry. Then they'll wish
they'd treated the troops a little better.

CONTACT: GUNTHER HERMANN

GUNTHER HERMANN
Next you will need to breech the doors in the hallway. Throw a LAM down to the
end of the hall. Once it blows proceed down the corridor.
Notice how the wooden door was destroyed and the metal and barred doors
remained. Remember this for future reference. Beyond the destroyed door you can
see a damaged piece of wall you can also breech with a LAM. Try that now.
Excellent! Notice that the wall is opened. Look for other weakened walls such as
this and your LAM and other explosives will allow you to breech them. Continue
through that breech and onto the next section.
The area beyond the door is the grenade defusing facility. Here you will learn
how to remove planted explosive device.
At each of the corners of this area you will find a LAM planted on the wall. You
must disarm and remove all 4 LAM's before you can proceed to the next section of
training. You will need to move up to the LAM quickly and defuse it by right
clicking. A second right click will remove the LAM from the wall.
A word of warning, Agent Denton. This was a simulated experience; real LAMs will
not be so forgiving. You may proceed to the next area.

CONTACT: ANNA NAVARRE

ANNA NAVARRE
Now you will learn to move quietly and conceal yourself, so that you will be
able to avoid a confrontation altogether.
The test is simple. Get to the far north door without being spotted by the
guards below. If one of them sees you, he will sound an alarm and lock the door.

DATACUBE

UNATCO STEALTH GUIDELINES
Overview

Stealth is a vital component of all UNATCO operations; when implemented
correctly, stealth missions result in the lowest possible ratio of agent and
civilian casualties to hostile losses.
Situational awareness is key, and agents should not only be familiar with the
tactical opportunities offered by their immediate environment, but how those
opportunities can be exploited to their advantage with the appropriate
equipment. Tech goggles allow agents to operate in low-light environments such
as offices or labs where illumination might otherwise attract attention. With
binoculars, an agent can survey an opponent's disposition and determine the best
way to evade or eliminate their defenses. A rifle or crossbow equipped with
scope and silencing modifications can be used to interdict targets from a
considerable distance, significantly compromising hostile resistance.
Other features of the environment can also be used by an agent to enhance their
ability to operate covertly or to create useful distractions: disabling security
cameras, subverting autoguns, and reprogramming bots are all viable tactics
employed by experienced agents in the field.

CONTACT: ANNA NAVARRE

ANNA NAVARRE
Remember: don't let the guards see you. Use the crates for cover and crouch when
you move.
Always remember the four basic tactics to avoid detection: crouch behind
concealment, stay behind enemies, move slowly to avoid making noise, and use
shadows to conceal yourself. Be alert to every possibility.
You blew it. The alarm just closed the north door. Return to the control room to
the south and press the button in the overlook window to restart the test.
This time, don't let the guards see you. Stay crouched, stay behind the crates,
and stay behind the guards.
The guards can be distracted. Pick up and throw an object near them, and they
will go investigate the noise. Bottles, plants, flasks -- many things will work.
Very good. I hope you remember this lesson, Agent. They have assigned us to be
partners, and I will not stop to hold your hand and repeat myself when we are
facing a real enemy.

CONTACT: JAIME REYES

JAIME REYES
Now for the last test. You have to find a way across the river to the exit on
the other side. There's more than one way to get there, depending on your
approach and the skills you want to use. It's up to you... Make use of the IFF
system to identify enemies. The crosshairs will highlight red over enemies,
green over allies, and white over neutrals.
Careful around this TNT. You can pick up the boxes and move them around, but
crouch to set them down. I don't want to have to reattach your arms.

Hey J.C., want to cross the water? Lower the bridge. The code is:

Step up to each hologram for more info. When you're through, go out the opposite
door.
A deployment of UNATCO troopers is the central component of all UN peacekeeping
occupations.
The NSF: the biggest terrorist threat in the U.S. This national militia group
thinks it is fighting the Second American Revolution.
Step over to the communicator. There's someone who wants to talk to you.
Manderley likes to hear which agents find this area. They're usually the ones
who take terrorists by surprise in the field. Your brother, Paul, for instance.
All right, carry on. Don't let it go to your head.
This Page Industries walking turret, marketed to governments worldwide, is the
workhorse of most national military forces. Due to the heavy armor, they take
little damage from ordinary bullets. If you come up against a bot, you should
use an EMP grenade, scrambler grenade, or some kind of explosive.
An inexpensive security bot, a favorite of Third World countries and corporate
security divisions. Not so mobile, but don't be fooled: we've lost plenty of
agents to its well-armored assault gun. Like other bots, it's difficult to
damage with ordinary bullets.
This is the old augmentation technology, hopefully about to be phased out.
Notice the reliance on electronics and servomechanics. A maintenance nightmare.
If I had two credits for every repair manual they've made me file in my office
in the Med Lab...
The Coalition's new nano-augmented agents are nearly indistinguishable from the
general population, except that you and your brother don't know how to smile,
even for a picture.

CONTACT: BOB PAGE

BOB PAGE
Sufficiently impressive. An early success for the whole organization.

JC DENTON
Thanks. You from the United Nations?

BOB PAGE
Your augmentations are a-go. The real test comes next: active duty.

JC DENTON
I'm ready, sir.

BOB PAGE
Yes. Yes, you are.

INTRO

CONVERSATION: BOB PAGE & WALTON SIMONS

BOB PAGE
Your appointment to FEMA should be finalized within the week. I've already
discussed the matter with the Senator.

WALTON SIMONS
I take it he was agreeable?

BOB PAGE
He didn't really have a choice.

WALTON SIMONS
Has he been infected?

BOB PAGE
Oh yes, most certainly. When I mentioned that we could put him on the priority
list for the Ambrosia vaccine, he was so willing it was almost pathetic.

WALTON SIMONS
This plague -- the rioting is intensifying to the point where we may not be able
to contain it.

BOB PAGE
Why contain it? Let it spill over into the schools and churches, let the bodies
pile up in the streets. In the end, they'll beg us to save them.

WALTON SIMONS
I've received reports of armed attacks on shipments. There's not enough vaccine
to go around, and the underclasses are starting to get desperate.

BOB PAGE
Of course they're desperate. They can smell their death, and the sound they'll
make rattling their cage will serve as a warning to the rest.

WALTON SIMONS
Mmm. I hope you're not underestimating the problem. The others may not go as
quietly as you think -- intelligence indicates they're behind the problems in
Paris.

BOB PAGE
A bunch of pretentious old men playing at running the world. But the world left
them behind long ago. We are the future.

WALTON SIMONS
We have other problems.

BOB PAGE
UNATCO?

WALTON SIMONS
Formed by executive order after the terrorist strike on the Statue. I have
someone in place, though. I'm more concerned about Savage -- he's relocated to
Vandenberg.

BOB PAGE
Our biochem corpus is far in advance of theirs, as is our electronic sentience.
And their... ethical inflexibility has allowed us to make progress in areas they
refuse to consider.

WALTON SIMONS
The augmentation project?

BOB PAGE
Among other things -- but I must admit that I have been somewhat disappointed in
the performance of the primary unit.

WALTON SIMONS
The secondary unit should be online soon. It's currently undergoing preparation
and will be operational within six months. My people will continue to report on
his progress. If necessary, the primary will be terminated.

BOB PAGE
We've had to endure much, you and I, but soon there will be order again, a new
age. Aquinas spoke of the mythical City on the Hill. Soon that city will be a
reality, and we will be crowned its kings. Or better than kings. Gods.

NYC - LIBERTY ISLAND

CONVERSATION: UNATCO BOAT PILOT

PILOT
My orders are to stay here.
I'd let the bots do the fighting if I were you.
I'm glad this thing has bullet-proof glass.

CONTACT: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX JACOBSON
Heads up, JC. Your brother Paul is on his way to meet you at the dock. The NSF
is raiding the island, and shots have been fired. I repeat: find Paul. I will
monitor your situation from HQ.

CONVERSATION: PAUL DENTON

JC DENTON
Paul! I thought you were in Hong Kong.

PAUL DENTON
Welcome to the Coalition, JC... I might as well start using your codename. Think
I'd miss my brother's first day?

JC DENTON
Didn't think you'd have a choice. What's going on?

PAUL DENTON
The NSF -- they hit one of our shipments. A few of them got away, but we trapped
the rest in the Statue.

JC DENTON
What are we waiting for? Looks like a textbook assault.

PAUL DENTON
The NSF took one of our agents hostage. The bots are holding the perimeter, but
my orders are to hold back and send you in alone. I think someone high up wants
to see how you handle the situation.

JC DENTON
All I've got with me is a pistol and an electric prod. I don't mind a test, but
UNATCO better issue some hardware.

PAUL DENTON
Remember that we're police. Stick with the prod. It will stun your opponents or
knock them unconscious. A nonlethal takedown is always the most silent way to
eliminate resistance. Just in case, though, Manderley wants you to pick an
additional weapon: a sniper rifle, a GEP gun, or a minicrossbow.

1.  JC DENTON
    I like to pick 'em off from a distance. I'll take the rifle.

PAUL DENTON
This isn't a training exercise, JC. Your targets will be human beings. Keep that
in mind.

JC DENTON
I get up the idea. What's the first move?

2.  JC DENTON
    Never know when I might come up against heavy armor. Give me the GEP gun.

PAUL DENTON
The GEP gun might be useful. They have a security bot on patrol near the Statue
entrance.

JC DENTON
Great. What's the first move?

3.  JC DENTON
    The crossbow. Sometimes you've got to make a silent takedown.

PAUL DENTON
Good thinking. With these tranquilizer darts, you'll have another nonlethal way
to take down an enemy in addition to the prod.

JC DENTON
I get the idea. What's the first move?

PAUL DENTON
I'm going to give you a map of the island. If you can get to the north dock, a
UNATCO informant will give you a key to the Statue doors. He responds to the
code-phrase "iron and copper." You could avoid a lot of fighting, though, if you
found a back way into the Statue.

JC DENTON
I'll see how it looks onshore.

PAUL DENTON
Your primary objective is the makeshift command center the terrorists installed
at the top of the Statue, but don't forget about Agent Hermann. We think he's
being held on the ground floor.

JC DENTON
What are my orders when I reach the command center?

PAUL DENTON
Interrogate the leader. We don't yet know why the terrorists would risk an open
assault.

JC DENTON
You just going to stay here?

PAUL DENTON
There's been some activity at sea. I'm going to watch the coast.

JC DENTON
Why'd they bring you back to New York?

PAUL DENTON
I don't know what they have planned. I messed up an assassination attempt on one
of the Triad leaders in Hong Kong.

JC DENTON
UNATCO pulled you out?

PAUL DENTON
It's a long story. You better head to the Statue.

JC DENTON
Which Triad was UNATCO targeting?

PAUL DENTON
We'll talk about that later. How was your graduation?

JC DENTON
I want to hear what happened.

PAUL DENTON
I wish I could have come. At the time I could have cared less that Mom and Dad
came to mine, but it was a good thing. The U.N. threw a dinner in honor of me,
the first nano-augmented agent.

JC DENTON
I didn't know that. Guess I must be old news.

PAUL DENTON
Dad made a toast. I don't know if you remember his old brown suit...

JC DENTON
A toast? That doesn't sound like our father.

PAUL DENTON
It was hard for him in front of the diplomats, but he savored every moment.

JC DENTON
Strange how proud he could be when so much was due to... our augmentations.

PAUL DENTON
Yes, he was proud. I believe that much. It was nice to have done something for
him and Mom. I wish someone could have been there for you.

JC DENTON
I'm used to being on my own.

PAUL DENTON
One can be TOO self-sufficient, I'm coming to believe.
Best thing is to let the bots handle the ground assault.
You might be able to find some supplies in the comm van by the helipad.
Hard to believe this rock used to be a tourist attraction, huh?
I'll keep watch on this side of the island.

CONVERSATION: NSF TERRORIST 1 & NSF TERRORIST 2

TERRORIST 1
That's the difference right there. Just take a look at him.

TERRORIST 2
Bad?

TERRORIST 1
They cut off his arm, replaced half of his face.

TERRORIST 2
Hermann, right? He's a good soldier. Killed three of our men.

TERRORIST 1
They'd've replaced his whole body if it would've improved performance. If that's
how you judge a man -- by performance -- then eventually it's not about people
but upgrades, versions, functionality...

TERRORIST 2
All I know is we could use a few mechs for ops like this.

TERRORIST 1
Soon as we buy into the cult of the machine we're just like them.

TERRORIST 2
Rhetoric, always more rhetoric.

CONVERSATION: MERCENARY THUG

MERCENARY THUG
...like Billy the Kid, man... We’re outlaws.

CONVERSATION: UNATCO TROOP (CORPORAL COLLINS)

JC DENTON
What's your take on the situation, Corporal?

COLLINS
The bots have them bottled up, sir. We'd go right in, if it weren't for the
hold-back order.

JC DENTON
How'd they get one of our agents?

COLLINS
Gunther went rogue on us. When the order came, he wouldn't pull back. Now you
get to bail him out.
Welcome aboard, Agent.
If they come this way, I got 'em, sir.
Well, I certainly see the family resemblance.
Those rebels are no match for our bots.

CONTACT: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX
NSF everywhere, JC. Your orders are to shoot on sight. A UNATCO informant on the
North Dock can get you inside the statue. Look for a Bum. Identify yourself with
the phrase "Iron and Copper."
If you want to make a covert approach, remember the academy stealth course: stay
out of their field of view, walk slowly to stay quiet, and crouch behind cover.
Or if you have to get your hands dirty, remember that a headshot is a lethal
takedown.
Be careful; the NSF have set up patchwork security systems here.

CONVERSATION: TECH SERGEANT KAPLAN

KAPLAN
Afraid base is under lockdown 'til the danger's gone, Agent Denton.

JC DENTON
Right. How you guys holding up?

KAPLAN
UNATCO command made us pull back, I guess for Gunther's sake. What's the deal?
We're ready to go in.

1.  JC DENTON
    I can't speak for command, but I'm gonna clean the place out.

KAPLAN
I hear ya. Manderley's right: you nano-augs are born and bred killers.

JC DENTON
I do my best.

KAPLAN
Better load up. There are some crates of ammo stashed in the antenna shaft
behind the helipad. Might also want to check out the comm van next to it. The
code's 0451.

JC DENTON
Thanks. I won't let you down.

KAPLAN
My tactic, when there's no cover like this, is to pick 'em off from fifty or a
hundred paces with a scope. What do you think? I scored an extra one from a
couple of thugs we dropped down by the dock; you can have it for 700 credits. I
also picked up 10 mm ammo and some crossbow tranquilizer darts -- say 200 for
one and 60 for the other.

2.  JC DENTON
    We're taking a minimum-force approach. We're cops, after all.

KAPLAN
Ask me, I think we should frag 'em all. You trespass on UNATCO property, you get
pumped full of lead.

JC DENTON
When due process fails us, we really do live in a world of terror.

KAPLAN
Thought your nano-augs were supposed to be badass killing machines. Guess I was
wrong.

JC DENTON
Guess so.

KAPLAN
Some advice. You get out there, you're gonna have to tangle with some real sons-
of-bitches. Best thing is to pick 'em off from fifty or a hundred paces with a
scope. I scored an extra one from a couple of thugs we dropped down by the dock;
you can have it for 700 credits. I also picked up 10 mm ammo and some crossbow
darts -- say 200 for one and 60 for the other.

JC DENTON
Shouldn't you turn that stuff over to the quartermaster?

KAPLAN
Sure, I will, but 'long as command has the rest of us on parade drills, someone
might as well put this hardware to use.

1.  JC DENTON
    I'll take the scope for 700.

KAPLAN
Just attach this baby to your pistol and you're in business.

2.  JC DENTON
    Here's 60 for the tranquilizer darts.

3.  JC DENTON
    200 for 10 mm ammo -- sounds good.

2-3.1
KAPLAN
So much for that "minimum-force" approach.

4.  JC DENTON
    I'll check back with you later.

    4.1

CONVERSATION: UNATCO TROOP

TROOP
Welcome aboard, Agent.
Everything was clear an hour ago. Then, BOOM!
My orders are to hang back.
If I catch a sight of the NSF commander at the top of the Statue, I'm gonna take
a shot. Screw Manderley.
The thugs must be desperate to attack us here.
I don't like just standing around, but orders are orders.
Whatever was in that barge, the NSF sure wanted it bad.
Careful, Agent. Rebels are crawling all over the place.
I've got this area secured.

DATACUBE

Brother,
I've set up the turrets and cameras in the statue ruins... a hasty defense, but
since we won't be here long, it should work. The security computer login is:
NSF001. The password is: smashthestate.

CONTACT: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX
This power box must have been damaged in the raid. Don't cross through the arcs.
I'm also picking up an EMP field here... if you're not careful it'll suck away
your bioelectrical energy.
It all happened an hour ago -- the barge docked and the NSF moved right in on
it, offloading the cargo into speedboats. Our undercover man Harley Filben
should be somewhere out on the docks now.

CONVERSATION: HARLEY FILBEN

FILBEN
About time you showed up.

JC DENTON
Iron and copper. The statue is copper on an iron frame, right?

FILBEN
Password's enough, pal. Don't think you know something about the Lady I don't.
My dad did tours out here.

JC DENTON
I heard that you can get me inside.

FILBEN
Depends. You get your man out, take back the Statue, whatever, but I know the
commander and I don't want to see him get hurt.
Here's a picture so you don't make a mistake.

1.  JC DENTON
    You can trust me.

FILBEN
I'll take your word. Here's the key to the front entrance. The commander's not
much of a soldier; he'll surrender as soon as he sees you. I need him alive
because he's my main contact at the NSF. If he's dead, I don't have much of a
business.

JC DENTON
Thanks.
How do you know so much about the commander?

FILBEN
He's my main contact in the NSF. I need him alive and out on bail.

JC DENTON
UNATCO will probably keep him in custody.

FILBEN
At least he has a chance if he's alive. I warned him, you know. I said right to
his face, "Don't take weapons into the Lady. That makes you as bad as UNATCO."

JC DENTON
Don't forget that it was the NSF that C-4'ed the Statue in the first place.
UNATCO's here to put the pieces back together.

FILBEN
Ask me, I think the government did it. They want people to think the NSF are
terrorists.
I better get paid good for this.
Remember, you said you wouldn't go in shooting.
My dad used to say, "If copper can get old and green and need repairs, the same
with our liberty." Funny, and that was before the United Nations even had an
army.
I worked here one summer picking up people's trash. Rotten job.
It used to be wall-to-wall people out here from all over the world. Everywhere
some other language you can't understand.

2.  JC DENTON
    I can't promise. In the line of duty I may have to use force.

FILBEN
Buddy, I don't know. The commander's not much of a soldier; he'll surrender
right away.

JC DENTON
I don't see anyone waving a white flag.

FILBEN
He's my main contact at the NSF. I need him alive and out on bail, or I don't
have much of a business. You can forget the key.

JC DENTON
We have an emergency here -- a terrorist offensive on U.N.-protected territory.
Do you work for UNATCO or not?

FILBEN
There's more than one way into the Statue. You wanna kill rebels -- you're on
your own. Yeah -- you should sneak in from the back. Less chance of a shootout
that way.

JC DENTON
You holding out for more money? What's the deal?

FILBEN
Sorry. I'm not playing along this time. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with
the NSF. I told 'em, "You bring the guns into the Lady, you're just as bad as
UNATCO..."

JC DENTON
Don't forget that it was the NSF that C-4'ed the Statue in the first place.
UNATCO's here to put the pieces back together.

FILBEN
Ask me, I think the government did it. They want people to think the NSF are
terrorists.
None of these guys is like my best pal, but who wants to see a bunch of dead
bodies, right?
I'll come through next time. Don't worry.
If you're that determined, I'm sure you can get in another way.

CONVERSATION: DRIFTER WOMAN

JC DENTON
You with Filben?

WOMAN
I get a cut for bringing him over.

JC DENTON
Tell me what you know about the NSF operation.

WOMAN
I'm not that high-level. The more elite troops -- they're the ones that took
over the ship and unloaded it into speedboats. I think we're supposed to be a
diversion.

JC DENTON
A ship?

WOMAN
That's all I know. The commander gave me a 10 mm clip, a box of 30-ought-six
ammo, and some crossbow darts and said, "Keep your head down" -- huh, like I'm
gonna take on UNATCO troops. Want 'em? You can have the clip for 175, the 30.06
for 300, and the darts for 50. But if I was you, I'd avoid a head-on attack
altogether and not even use the key Filben got. I'd go in the Statue from the
back. Less security that way.

1.  JC DENTON
    I'll take the 10 mm clip for 175.

WOMAN
Put a slug in the commander for me. He's the reason my brother's dead.

2.  JC DENTON
    Here's 300. Give me the 30.06 ammo.

WOMAN
Thanks.

3.  JC DENTON
    I'll give you 50 for the darts.

WOMAN
The commander's the whole reason my neighbourhood turned into a war zone.
Someone should stick him full of these things like a roast pig.

(WOMAN
Sure you can't buy some ammo?

JC DENTON
50 for the darts is a good deal, but I don't have it.

1.  WOMAN
    Well, come back if you get the chance. I sure could use the money.

2.  WOMAN
    I'd give you a break but I'm in a kind of a tight spot myself.

3.  WOMAN
    You know where to find me.)

4.  JC DENTON
    No thanks.

WOMAN
That's all I got.
Thanks for the extra cash.
At least I got SOMETHING for coming all the way out here.

CONTACT: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX
Good thinking; you might be able to avoid some of the security by entering this
way.
A shame, isn't it? The French terrorist group Silhouette claims that France was
wrong to give the U.S. the Statue. We think they planned the bombing.
I think Gunther is being held beyond this laser triggered alarm. If you don't
want to set off the alarm, you can either hack the control panel in the doorway
or find a way around... My blueprint of the Statue shows a few airshafts.
The NSF put a commercial-grade security bot in this area. You can either avoid
its patrol route or, if you're feeling lucky, try to take it out with EMP
grenades or explosives. I wouldn't recommend taking it on with small arms.
Gunther's in that room. One of our top agents.
This security setup is strictly amateur stuff -- keep an eye out for ways to
bypass it. These old pre-milenial buildings are riddled with ventilation shafts
and maintenance tunnels.

A Lesson for Our President
Family News Network -- Dave Wary Editorial

When the other kids on my block elected me King of the World, a political office
open (thankfully) only to eight-year-olds, I moved quickly to consolidate my
power. I declared that all subsequent elections were forbidden, that the office
of King was reserved to me and my descendants for all eternity.
I don't remember what morsels of political philosophy were hurled at me. "That
ain't fair!" perhaps, or "You can't do that!"
My rebuttal? "Yes I can. I'm King."
All subsequent debate involved rocks. Even Gretchen, green-eyed lovely Gretchen,
held me pinned to the ground as the others asserted their own right to the
throne with whatever stones happened to be within easy reach.
With a 35 percent approval rating after the U.N. funding fiasco, President Mead
should reflect that these children -- and millions of other free thinkers --
have reached voting age.
Who wants to cast the first stone?

CONVERSATION: GUNTHER HERMANN

GUNTHER HERMANN
Agent! Open the door.
Get me a weapon.
They had us surrounded. I was forced to surrender.
I am ready to counterattack.
Now everyone will see why I need a skull-gun.
The rebels will soon wish they had killed me.

JC DENTON
Glad you're not hurt, Agent.

GUNTHER HERMANN
Command should not have left us to be surrounded.

JC DENTON
Risk is part of the job. I think you lucked out this time.

GUNTHER HERMANN
Agent Navarre and I were ready to go in, but for no reason they said pull back.
I do not retreat. Please give me a weapon and move out of the way.

1.  JC DENTON
    As you wish. Take my pistol.

GUNTHER HERMANN
That will be adequate. I will secure this level. You proceed up the stairs to
the command center at the top.
I will clean out the lower level.
You go after the leader.
A recruit is very valuable if he can operate in a team.

2.  JC DENTON
    First thing is to get you out of here. I'll handle the enemy.

GUNTHER HERMANN
Excuse that I have forgotten your brother Paul Denton and the infinite power of
nano-augmentation.

JC DENTON
I just can't spare any arms. Please retreat to a safe location.

GUNTHER HERMANN
Go ahead. Advance up the stairs to the command center at the top. I will take my
rusty metal bones and sweep away into the junk pile.
Now I see the reason for the pull-back. They wanted to show off their new
nanoaugmentation technology.

CONVERSATION: MERCENARY THUG (AMOS) & NSF TERRORIST (JACKSON)

MERCENARY THUG
Did they find the shipment?

NSF TERRORIST
Yeah, we got the whole supply. You can see the ship's lights crossing the bay.

MERCENARY THUG
Guess y'all were right. So why aren't we pulling out?

NSF TERRORIST
Mike's on the horn. JoJo wants a lead on the distribution network.

MERCENARY THUG
Hell, we don't have enough men to protect what we've got.

NSF TERRORIST
That's what JoJo wants.

MERCENARY THUG
I wonder. How's a guy with a tattooed forehead get to be an NSF colonel? Pardon
me, but back in Alabama we wouldn't let a man who wears earrings plan a military
operation.

NSF TERRORIST
I'd watch what I say about JoJo. He's got a temper.

MERCENARY THUG
He's a punk and he's gonna get us all killed.

NSF TERRORIST
The NSF is strong because it represents everyone's interests.

MERCENARY THUG
Yeah, yeah.

CONTACT: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX
Gunther has reestablished contact. He says you helped him escape. Good work.
(Good. You're nearing the command center. Agent Hermann remains in captivity on
the ground floor, but we can probably get him out. Keep moving.)
Some news, JC. The NSF targeted a shipment of the plague vaccine, Ambrosia. We
can't locate it. See if the leader will surrender when you reach the command
post. We'd like to interrogate him.

Ask away. We already won this round.

JC DENTON

GOLD
We're just giving the ordinary people the same chance to survive as the
bureaucrats in Washington.

CONVERSATION: NSF TERRORIST LEADER (LEO GOLD)

JC DENTON
Just answer the question.

GOLD
Don't believe me? It's all in the numbers. For a hundred years, there's been a
conspiracy of plutocrats against ordinary people.

JC DENTON
Do you have a single fact to back that up?

GOLD
Number one: In 1945 corporations paid 50 percent of federal taxes. Now they pay
about 5 percent. Number two: In 1900 90 percent of Americans were self-employed;
now it's about two percent.

JC DENTON
So?

GOLD
It's called consolidation. Strengthen governments and corporations, weaken
individuals. With taxes, this can be done imperceptibly over time.

JC DENTON
I guarantee you that the interrogation staff at UNATCO will not be as forbearing
as I am.

GOLD
Yeah, the secret police. You're just bullies for a completely illegitimate
government in Washington.

JC DENTON
We will locate that shipment one way or another.

GOLD
The entire executive branch is hand-picked. Nineteen of the last twenty-three
U.S. presidents have been members of the Trilateral Commission. The Trilateral
Commission is financed by the Rockefellers and the Rotschilds. Don't tell me --

JC DENTON
That's a think-tank. Anyone can become a member.

GOLD
But not everyone does. That's why they call it the "secret government."
You can't fight ideas with bullets.
Do you ever ask what it's for? The surveillance, the police, the shoot-on-sight
laws? Is that freedom?
UNATCO teaches teenagers to fight when it still seems like a game, and -- look
at you! -- you're a killing machine!
Who's the scary one, huh? Me or you?
The more of us you kill, the more that secessionism lives in the hearts of the
people.
Ever wonder why big car companies pay two percent tax while the guys on the
assembly line pay forty?
Corporations are so big you don't even know who you're working for. That's
terror. Terror built into the system.

TROOP 2
They sent us to pick up the pieces. We've already searched the bodies and
delivered the enemy munitions to the quartermaster.
Don't worry about the bodies -- we'll handle the cleanup.

also picked up 10 mm ammo and some crossbow darts -- say 200 for one and 60 for
the other.

Shouldn't you turn that stuff over to the quartermaster?

PAUL DENTON
We could have learned a lot from their leader.

JC DENTON
He wasn’t cooperative. Alex said something about an Ambrosia shipment...

PAUL DENTON
They captured a boat-load of Ambrosia, the plague vaccine. We might have found
out from the leader where they’re taking it.

JC DENTON
So they just disappeared? We don’t know their location?

PAUL DENTON
Manderley will brief us shortly. You better get to his office on Level 2 and
report for duty.

NYC - UNATCO HQ

NEWSPAPER

Mead Bucks Congress
APR - Washington, D.C.

Defying Congress for the third time this year, President Mead unilaterally paid
the United States' late dues to the United Nations. "Like good tenants, we must
pay our rent on time," he told reporters.
Leaders of both parties criticized the move. "Where does he get the cash?" asked
Senator Ridon (D-Illinois). "Clearly from some budget item yet to be approved by
this Congress."
The Republicans were no kinder. "This council member has been betrayed, and so
has America," said Senator Osno Liverpoole (R-California). "The Congress came
together to approve a UNATCO presence on U.S. soil, but we did not write a blank
check. No, sir. A superpower does not pay rent."

BOOK

UNATCO HANDBOOK
Welcome to UNATCO!

CLASSIFICATION: The U.N. has nine levels of security above Top Secret. This
manual and all material that is not otherwise marked is classified as Angel/0A.
If you are not Angel/0A or above, report immediately to your supervisor or face
disciplinary action. Other classifications will be explained upon reaching
higher clearance.
In its efforts to combat terrorism, the U.N. has created UNATCO for the swift
deployment of a COORDINATED FORCE to counteract any insurgent operations. You
are justifiably proud to be part of this organization: your physical
capabilities place you within the upper one percent of national ground combat
units, while your mental capabilities have been honed to sharpness by the UNATCO
Academy.
But as part of a larger organization, you also understand the necessity to HEED
ORDERS from your superiors without hesitation; your superiors are typically
briefed on matters for which you may not be cleared, and hesitation on the part
of an agent can result in the serious IMPAIRMENT of mission objectives and
attendant CASUALTIES.
UNATCO has faith in you, and this faith will be REWARDED in due time as your
operational capacities are increased. Brave the darkness, for you carry the
torch of freedom.

BOOK

UNATCO HANDBOOK
UNATCO and the Public

In carrying out our duties, UNATCO agents often come in contact with the public.
You are a PEACEKEEPER, and your first objective is to safeguard human life.
Though terrorists may see an advantage in harming civilians, UNATCO agents do
not. Issue a warning before firing at a suspect and always instruct bystanders
to "get down on the ground." Refrain from firing into large crowds. Every
civilian hurt is collateral damage.
However, keep in mind that no civilian with a clearance below Angel/0A should be
trusted and may be a potential spy. ANYONE can be a spy, and secrecy is our
ally.
REMEMBER: WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

For example: the voice in your head (from an operator, someone here at HQ able
to handle the scanning equipment in your skull and broadcast advice over your
"infolink") leaps fully formed right into your temporal lobe, bypassing the
eardrum and its sensory neurons. And it's perfectly inaudible to everyone around
you, of course. Not to mention that the nanites clinging to your axons can both
receive and transmit symbolic information, so if you ever need help, don't sweat
it; someone at HQ probably already knows.
Come by if you want to hear more... this is great stuff...

---

By now, you've heard about the upcoming transition to nano-augmentation. It's
coming, but not as soon as you think. UNATCO has only one nano-augmented agent,
with a second just now graduating from the Academy. It will be years before the
program leaves the laboratory.
Your mechanical augmentations are NOT obsolete. Some agents express concern that
they will be "walking junk" in ten years. One agent expressed their fears in an
anonymous e-mail saying "Well be sld at flee markets,. old gray golems for
scareing the children. So what about my legss? What about my LIFE?" [sic]
Keep some perspective. Prosthetics remain the only proven technology for
enhancing human abilities. Those who make the sacrifice are appreciated,
commended, and saluted as heroes.

Subject: Nano-Augmentation Stressors

Nano-augmented agents will often encounter stress created by resentment among
fellow agents, particularly those who have been mechanically augmented.
In an effort to secure freedom and liberty for those under their protection,
many UNATCO agents have chosen to sacrifice social acceptance for mission
performance by surgically replacing limbs and organs with mechanically or
electronically enhanced equivalents. But your nano-augmentations points the way
to the future: thousands of microscopic, living, organic machines that exist in
symbiosis with your body.
Because such augmentations create only minimal disfigurement, they are likely to
be a source of friction between you and other mechanically augmented agents --
but it is important to understand that UNATCO is an organization where
individuals must act in concert. Each is important to the whole, and mutual
understanding is essential to teams comprised of diverse human and augmented
agents.
If you have any further questions or wish to discuss these issues, please feel
free to send email to CarverEschells\\UNATCO.4352.768 to make an appointment.
And welcome to UNATCO, agent.

Mead from Mars!

CAPE CANAVERAL -- NASA scientists confirmed that the eroded remains of the Alba
Patera crater on Mars precisely match the face of President Mead. "It's him!"
declared Senior Planetary Specialist Kevlar Umla. "There's his nose, that ridge,
see? See the crater rim marking his hairline? The way he combs his hair
appearing in this region of parallel valleys?"
The White House had no comment. However, Martin Wisdom, president of EA (Enemies
of Aliens), told Midnight Sun: "This is the evidence we have been looking for, a
warning that Mr. Mead is not human. He is probably a Martian General, a war
hero, come here to conquer the Earth with the assistance of the United Nations."

BULLETINS

Terrorism -- Crime or Conscience?

The question must be asked: is the global rise of terrorism a haphazard response
to a decimated economy or is there a pattern? Does UNATCO face coordinated
ideological opposition?
Some groups -- Silhouette in France, for instance -- have declared a "Meme War,"
or "war of meanings" in their terminology. They spread email and pamphlets that
lampoon the U.N.'s proposal for a one-world democracy, a tedious exercise in
rudimentary propaganda. With sophistries and doublespeak, they portray "freedom"
as "obedience," "democracy" as "tyranny," and UNATCO as the perpetrator of
terrorism -- an idea as shocking as it is reprehensible.
Other organizations, such as the self-proclaimed revolutionary National
Seccessionist Forces (NSF) in the U.S., claim allegiance to the Meme War, but
are in fact no better than common criminals. They desire territory and wealth at
the expense of society at large. Their "civil war" is merely a smokescreen for
criminal activity.
Any population can be quickly turned against such "revolutionaries" simply by
educating them about the U.N.'s policies and goals.
-- Joseph Manderley, Director, UNATCO

Terrorism -- Threat Profiling

Symbolic attacks -- the Statue of Liberty bombing, the desecration of Soviet War
Memorial in Berlin, the department-store shooting-sprees on Orchard Road in
Singapore -- are the recourse of the weak. They serve only to call attention to
a group or cause that is of no more than marginal interest to the public.
But what distinguishes true terrorist activity is its gradual escalation towards
genuine acts of war. Fringe groups now have access to technology that allows
direct assaults on governments, including the classic trio of nuclear,
biological, or chemical weaponry (NBC). But aside from direct assaults on a
nation and its people, indirect attacks can cause considerable collateral damage
-- rogue software can disrupt financial markets, communications, and military
operations, while encryption programs allow terrorists to coordinate smuggling
operations in secret right over the Net! Drugs, guns, illegal immigrants, and
even heavy equipment such as armored vehicles and cruise missiles are routinely
traded across borders, aided and abetted by such software.
UNATCO -- the first organization with the technology, manpower, and authority to
cope with such threats -- is an idea that is long overdue.
-- Joseph Manderley, Director, UNATCO

Know Your Enemy -- NSF

The National Secessionist Forces (NSF) remain a very real and increasingly
widespread terrorist threat. Ten years ago, in response to the Sporting Weapons
Act of 2042, splinter groups from nearly every state militia refused to
surrender their rifles, grenades, land mines, and other "collectibles"
prohibited by the Act. Unified under the charismatic leadership of Leon Woods,
these isolated fanatics eventually formed the NSF with Woods assuming the rank
of General. Their intended goal: the "liberation" of Washington, Montana,
Oregon, and Northern California.
While Woods died during his infamous "last stand" in 2045, his war machine
continues what can only be termed an occupation of the United States, aided by
an encrypted network designed by dissident computer scientists from San
Francisco and Seattle. Currently, the UNATCO Cryptography Division has had
minimal success in cracking their communications, requiring more direct
intelligence gathering techniques to be utilized.
The U.N. has declared war on the NSF.

Know Your Enemy -- Silhouette

Famous for inserting 20th-century style commercials into the Net broadcast of
the World Cup in 2050, Silhouette favors "feats of spectacle" over violence.
"Printed circuits, part of this nutritious breakfast," the announcer told
children in one of the World Cup commercials. "You ain't mech 'til you eat mech.
[A mech boy chews a memory chip.] Boys who eat organics get stomped by their
posthuman classmates. [Mech boys in UNATCO helmets and metal boots take turns
kicking another boy.]"
Despite their numerous pranks, these intellectuals, artists, and labor
organizers pose a serious threat. They are well-armed and have been linked to
the murders of numerous European politicians and journalists. They will not
hesitate to use lethal force.

Know Your Enemy -- The Triads

UNATCO surveillance of Hong Kong is currently a high priority given the renewed
threat of Chinese organized crime in the form of the Triads. Despite being a
model of prosperity and technological leadership for decades, Hong Kong persists
as a haven for organized crime. The Triads, namely the Luminous Path and Red
Arrow, vie for control of the ten-trillion credit shipping business, much of
which supplies greater Asia with pirated technology, illegal drugs, and weapons.
Most disturbing of all, the Triads preach an ethic of technopiracy that has
found enthusiastic support among small shopkeepers and businessmen who often aid
the gangsters and buy their bootlegged software. Gullible and greedy, this army
of middlemen remain insensitive to how their violations of intellectual property
and copyright laws damage the global information economy.

Know Your Enemy -- Other Threats

UNATCO operatives have identified over 1250 terrorist organizations active in
the world today, some too small to currently present a serious threat, but all
eager to see one or more governments topple.
Groups such as the Templars (Europe) and "X-51" (Western U.S.) will be dealt
with in subsequent volumes of "Know Your Enemy."

UNATCO and the Police

In carrying our their duties, UNATCO agents often work with other law-
enforcement agencies.
We remain a small, elite organization. Until our ranks expand, we must rely on
the cooperation of local police, governments, intelligence agencies, and
corporate security divisions. Always be courteous when requesting information or
filing an extradition request. As our jurisdiction widens, we will inevitably
experience conflicts with some local officials. Do not resort to unnecessary
intimidation in these situations, and report any problems to the appropriate
UNATCO liaison. Above all, an international law enforcement body requires the
RESPECT and SUPPORT of all participating nations.

PROJECT DIBBUK
Overview
Domination/5F Clearance ONLY

...the noted failure of previous attempts to create a low profile rotary
aircraft involved the acquisition and retrofitting of available military
hardware that had neither the range, ceiling, nor electromagnetic transparency
to avoid numerous eyewitness accounts or unauthorized military interactions. In
addition to exacerbating public misconceptions about governmental operations,
such encounters also jeopardized several key missions. PROJECT DIBBUK was
initiated to address this issue through the creation of a "stealth" aircraft
that could be used as a platform for a number of mission objectives...

UNATCO and the World

For far too long terrorists have exploited international tensions and regional
legislative variations to elude authorities.
A significant step was made towards eliminating these legal loopholes when U.S.
President Philip Riley Mead lobbied the Congress to make the U.S. a UNATCO
member nation: "Enough is enough!" he declared in his landmark State of the
Union address, and the citizens of the United States responded with enthusiastic
endorsement of his position. Not only did the United States become a charter
member of UNATCO, but UNATCO headquarters are now located on Liberty Island in
the shadow of that shattered monument to FREEDOM.
UNATCO deals not only with terrorist threats, but also any transgressions of the
international legal code, including drug trafficking, software piracy, and money
laundering. With the full support of the United States, UNATCO was for the first
time able to truly declare itself the "WORLD'S POLICEMAN."

MATSU-GRAVAS GV-4 "NIGHTINGALE" MEDICAL BOT

The Matsu-Gravas GV-4 is the newest addition to the M-G line, their first foray
into the medical bot category largely monopolized by Page Industries and Chiang
subsidiary HealTech. Unlike the competing Page or HealTech units, the M-G GV-4
benefits from a completely proprietary operating system -- developed at M-G's
research campus in Prague -- that promises to revolutionize automated healing by
combining a comprehensive medical and pharmaceutical database with M-G's already
proven autonomous heuristic routines. While actual field data is sketchy at this
point of time, anecdotal evidence suggests that the GV-4 can heal wounds far
beyond the capabilities of any other competing model, though it does require a
substantial recharging period...

Subject: Nano-Augmentation Principal/2C Briefing

As a medical specialist, you will be required to repair and modify the systems
of our nano-augmented agents. This briefing is intended merely as an
introduction to the technology.
The cells of every major tissue in the body of a nano-augmented agent are host
to nanite-capsid "hybrids." These hybrids replicate in two stages: the viral
stage, in which the host cell produces capsid proteins and packages them into
hollowed viral particles, and the nanotech stage, in which the receiver-
transmitter and CPU are duplicated and inserted into the protective viral
coating. New RNA sequences are transmitted by microwave and translated in to
plasmid vectors, resulting in a wholly natural and organic process.
Additional augmentations can be added through the use of microscopic ROM modules
-- shaped a little like flying saucers -- that diffuse through the blood and
attach to the long spine of nanite CPUs. These additional augmentations are
software "upgrades" in the most literal sense of the word.
We hope this report gets you started; you will find a full technical design
document attached. Please read and thoroughly understand this information so
that you will be better qualified to administer care to this most exciting new
breed of augmented-human agent.

Gray Death: Look to the Sky

NEW YORK -- No student of recent history can fail to miss the irony that the
greatest enemy mankind has faced in the 21st century was not any despot or
dictator, but the lowly microbe. Millions upon millions have been killed by the
pandemics of AIDS, resistant tuberculosis, and the Century Flu, and now we face
our greatest threat yet: the "Gray Death," a plague of devastating efficiency
that has surfaced in the last year.
But was this plague an accident of nature, or a design of science? Dr. Kenji
Ishii of the New World Biomedical Health Center in New York thinks not. "My
analysis of this plague indicates that it is decidedly unnatural in origin, and
in point of fact, may be extraterrestrial." He went on to speculate about those
afflicted. "Obviously, a disproportionate number of the indigent seem to be
infected, a situation that makes perfect sense if you consider it prelude to an
invasion. No more effective way to disrupt the social, political, and military
fabric of Earth has yet been devised."
If this is so, then what are our leaders not telling us? And how can we be
prepared? Only they know the answers. -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer

Oh, Kaplan, right. We've got some screwballs around here, but he's not the

Someone at UNATCO's a thief?

Yes, sir, and a damn good one.
No time for chit-chat.
The NSF are in retreat. You better get going.
That is no time to be messing around.
You better leave that assinine behavior right here, soldier. It will get you

A pistol is more than adequate. Hell, I dispatched a whole platoon one time with

Mass Grave in Brooklyn
APR - New York

Responding to an outbreak of Gray Death that quickly overwhelmed all city
services, National Guard forces were placed under the command of local law
enforcement today and mobilized to help with disposal of the recently deceased
in Brooklyn.
However, the National Guard soon proved inadequate in containing the chaos and
in many cases the dead were simply left lying in streets while the dying --
mostly homeless -- wandered the city until collapsing. Traffic jams and looting
remain widespread, and as fear of the disease continues to escalate, frequent
riots have made any attempt at an organized clean-up impossible. With the threat
of secondary diseases looming, city officials have consulted with the CDC in
Atlanta and ordered a mass grave to be dug in Gateway National Park.

You better not keep them waiting.

CONVERSATION: JOSEPH MANDERLEY & PAUL DENTON

MANDERLEY
That will be JC's job.

JC DENTON
What's that?

PAUL DENTON
The power station. The NSF have the Ambrosia in a warehouse protected by cameras
and booby traps. We want to power down the whole system.

MANDERLEY
We're talking one illicit generating plant, protected by weak groups of NSF.
Knock out that plant, and Paul's team can walk right into the warehouse.

JC DENTON
Just tell me where it is.

PAUL DENTON
The NSF are openly resisting our deployed forces, gradually falling back. You'll
have to deal with them first.

MANDERLEY
And you be ready, Paul. When the power drops, go in and go in hard.

PAUL DENTON
I'll use my discretion.

MANDERLEY
Go in like the U.S. Marshals. We lose the vaccine, I'm sending your butt to the
Mayor to explain why he and his three daughters won't get their pills this
month.

PAUL DENTON
Yes, sir.
Let's not waste any time, JC. Get down to the dock. A boat is waiting to take
you and your partner Anna Navarre ashore.

MANDERLEY
Yes, get moving. Here's your op bonus for the great job you did in the Statue,
plus 250 for rescuing Agent Hermann. That's 1250. We take care of our people
around here.

JC DENTON
Thank you, sir.

MANDERLEY
By the way, Denton, stay out of the ladies restroom. That kind of activity
embarasses the agency more than it does you.
You'll come to admire your partner. She's one of our best.
Leave from where you arrived, Denton. The boat dock. Move it!
That's enough, Agent.
Move out, soldier.

UNATCO HANDBOOK
UNATCO and the Future

As science progresses at an ever increasing rate, more and more advanced
technology is finding its way into the hands of the common criminal, resulting
in a deadly threat to LIFE and PROPERTY throughout the world.
While it is impractical to restrict the free-flow of information already present
in the public sector, UNATCO is committed to insuring that this threat does not
go unaddressed. Even now, UNATCO research and development employs some of the
most talented scientific minds in the world to develop proprietary technologies
in absolute security for field use by our agents -- including such innovations
as the XXXXXXX XXXXX and XXXXXX, or the lifesaving XXXXX.
Under NO circumstances should agents discuss ANY piece of equipment or technique
currently employed by UNATCO. Agents operating contrary to this directive will
face immediate disciplinary action.
Within our laboratories lies not just the future of law enforcement, but a SAFE,
SECURE future for all mankind.

Bootcamp for Betty
APR - Portland

Madison High School junior Betty Souza will spend the semester at the Canyon
City Bootcamp, say school officials. The crime? "We have verified that she told
another student that she knows how to make a bomb," said Principal Martin
Gordly.
What makes this case notable is that the parents have filed a lawsuit against
the school district. "Our daughter wears black," said father Brandon Souza in a
prepared statement. "She had an occipital jack and we let her use it to play
games. We allowed her to get a tattoo when she turned 16, but none of this makes
her a criminal."
The parents claim that Betty was discussing a novel by Tom Robbins taught at
Madison High when the mention of explosives occurred.
Betty Souza will not be alone in Canyon City. Last year 15,234 young people
served sentences in the state's FBI-run "good-behavior" camps, a legacy of the
Northwest War.

U.S. Prez Sells Out

NEW YORK -- President Philip Riley Mead's executive order repaying the United
States debt to the United Nations is viewed by many as a positive step towards
global peace -- but others sense darker motives at work. Some sources have
privately commented that the order is nothing more than a tacit endorsement of a
new world government and its private military, the United Nations Anti-Terrorist
Coalition (UNATCO).
Few can forget Mead's impassioned declaration that the shattered Statue of
Liberty would not be repaired but instead stand as a reminder that "terrorism
must be eradicated if we are to be free." It was shortly thereafter that Liberty
Island was selected as the location of UNATCO headquarters, their dubious
charter highlighted by the mysterious and still largely unexplained
circumstances behind the Statue bombing.
No doubt President Mead's words will be remembered, even as he sells out his
country to the foreign powers that have sought to destroy it for nearly three
centuries. -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer

Exterminate?

No bean-bag shells like during a training exercise; real bullets tonight.
The Ambrosia is somewhere inside the Castle.

Water Advisory

Residents of Manhattan and Brooklyn should be aware that last week's chlorine
spill in the Hudson River now appears to have washed ashore and is interfering
with the operation of at least one water processing plant. While the impact upon
the city's utilities is currently unclear, water rationing rules may need to be
instituted within the next week.
Under NO circumstances should any resident drink, bathe, or swim in contaminated
water. If you or someone you know comes in contact with contaminated water then
go to the nearest available hospital or clinic.

Brooklyn Naval Yards Completes Sub Pen

In a ceremony held earlier today, the venerable Brooklyn Naval Yards christened
a new, state-of-the-art sub pen. New York Senator Clark Ashton was in
attendance, as was industrialist Bob Page whose subsidiaries handled many of the
contracts for the construction of the new building.
"This is certainly a great day for New York," said Page in a brief speech to
commemorate the occasion. "New York is, in many ways, the symbolic center of
America, an example not only to the rest of the country but the world. As long
as New York remains mindful of its past but dedicated towards realizing its
future, this will never change. This building is only a small -- but significant
-- step in the continual renewal of the city, and Page Industries is glad to be
a part of that."

Battery Park Closed Until Further Notice

Due to unidentified terrorist action, Battery Park will be closed to all
unauthorized personnel until further notice. Local police working in conjunction
with UNATCO agents are currently in the process of dealing with the threat, and
according to UNATCO head Joseph Manderley, "The situation is strictly minor, but
any time the potential exists for civilian casualties we must proceed with
caution."

Be Safe: Be Suspicious

Terrorism has become an unfortunate fact of life not only in New York but the
country at large, a direct assault on our communities and our way of life that
leaves citizens struggling to find answers to difficult questions, not the least
of which is "What can I do to prevent such atrocities? How can I help?"
Quite simply, terrorism is successful because terrorists are able to pass
unnoticed and unremarked upon -- but they fail to count on the best intelligence
network ever devised: the American people. How can you tell who might be a
terrorist? Look for the following characteristics:

- A stranger or foreigner.
- Argumentative, especially about politics or philosophy.
- Probing questions about your work, particularly high-tech.
- Spends a greater than average amount of time on the Net.
- Interests in chemistry, electronics, or computers.
- Large numbers of mail-order deliveries.
- Taking photographs of major landmarks.
  And those are just a few. If you're suspicious, then turn them in to your local
  law enforcement for a thorough background check. Better safe than sorry. You and
  your neighbors will sleep more securely knowing that you're watching each
  other's back.

JC DENTON
What were they after?

BUM
Especially when it's your ALLY. THEY came to us. THEY wanted an underground
base.

JC DENTON
So those guys were... NSF?

BUM
Yeah, the NSF gives guns to anybody who wants to fight. A lot of people just
take the guns and do what they want.

JC DENTON
So the terrorists are based... in the subways? The sewers?

BUM
They need to move some kind of secret equipment. Our tunnels are like the
crossroads.

JC DENTON
Tell me how to find this base and I bet I can get the NSF off your back.

BUM
"Underworld." Just remember that word when you see Curly. He lets people in.
Me, personally, I don't rob. I think it's wrong.
I think Curly went underground, but remember that password. You might need it
someday.
'Appreciate the help.
The NSF are all right. It's just some of the people that hang around 'em, you
know?

Court Upholds NY Grid Law
New World Press - Washington, D.C.

In a landmark six to three decision yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
controversial "grid zoning" laws that have been the subject of a number suits
since being instituted six years ago.
Originally passed by the New York legislature in 2046 in response to the Upper
West Side bombing that killed 45 people and wounded over a 100, the grid zoning
laws effectively allowed the police to wall off regions of Manhattan and its
surrounding boroughs. Foot traffic between these "zones" is prohibited, and
travelling between zones is restricted to authorized subways or highways subject
to police surveillance.
"A travesty," said Gil Treble, representing the ACLU as plaintiffs in the case.
"This law is nothing more than the legalization of social oppression on a grand
scale."
Supreme Court Justice Machen wrote in his favorable decision that "The
unfortunate nature of American liberty is that freedom creates opportunity for
terror. It is with heavy heart that I must conclude in this case that the
freedom of individual Americans must be balanced against the needs of a
community to feel safe and secure."

CONVERSATION: DAN, WOMAN & JORDAN SHEA

DAN
Buy Ambrosia from a drug dealer?
(Pardon me, sir.
...just letting off a little steam, I guess.
I’ll be glad when this thing is over.)

WOMAN
We're talking about your wife, the Gray Death...
(Excuse us -- we're having a conversation.
I said leave us alone.
Get lost.)

DAN
I don't know; if I gave it to her, and it was cut...

WOMAN
JoJo's good for it. People know him. He'd be hanging from a streetlight if he
was selling bad vaccine.
Hey, Shea. Cape Cod. Use a little vodka this time.

JORDAN
Coming up.

DAN
Guess I have to do something...

WOMAN
You would never forgive yourself if --

DAN
I know, I know.

WOMAN
It's to be expected. Ambrosia's a controlled substance. Most people don't even
think it exists.

DAN
To be paying in chits, in a grimy alley somewhere...

WOMAN
You oughta be thankful the dealers got their hands on it. A week from now --
Listen to me; I say this for your own good: next week it might be too late.

DAN
Yes?

1.  JC DENTON
    Just curious. Thought I heard you say Ambrosia.

DAN
My wife has the plague.

WOMAN
He already lost his daughter.

JC DENTON
I'm sorry to hear that.

DAN
So do I trust some street punk called JoJo to get me pharmaceuticals? Trust him
with my wife's life?

JC DENTON
I thought Ambrosia was an urban legend.

DAN
JoJo probably just wants to sound like a player. I shouldn't get my hopes up.

JC DENTON
I don't know what to say. You just have to do what you think is right.

DAN
I'm going to do it.

WOMAN
I'm glad. I hope she does better.

DAN
Can't be any worse for her than morphine.

WOMAN
Hey, Shea. One for the road.

JORDAN
Yes, ma'am.

JC DENTON
Can I ask a question?

DAN
Go right ahead.

JC DENTON
I'm looking around for a power generator, possibly hidden, large enough to power
a building.

DAN
You in real estate?

JC DENTON
I just need to find it.

DAN
Oh-oh-oh, of course. You know, I tied in power at a place a few blocks south, a
warehouse. Strangest thing. They wanted to conceal these gas-driven generators
on the second floor. Didn't give a hoot if their own people got asphyxiated.

JC DENTON
How do I get over there?

DAN
No way through the blockades now. We went over some rooftops to get there; there
was a lift -- the code was 3316, I think.

JC DENTON
Thanks for the tip.

DAN
I also worked on their hydraulic system. If you ask me, I don't think one of
those guys has seen a generator before in his life.
You're a good man, Agent.
Crummy part of town, isn't it?
Beer's my favorite financial instrument. It's true; you can TASTE an economy
going sour.
Hey, what is this stuff? Heavy water?

JORDAN
You don't have to drink it.

WOMAN
I think he should do it.
His wife is very sick.
Hi, my name is Meg.

2.  JC DENTON
    Tell me where you plan to get Ambrosia or I'll make sure you're arrested on
    conspiracy charges.

DAN
You a cop? We were just talking...

WOMAN
Mind your own business.

JC DENTON
So Ambrosia's been sold on the street...

JORDAN
Hey, back off, mister. Leave the customers alone.

WOMAN
Yeah, back off.

DAN
So... the Stanley account is... concluded?

WOMAN
More strikes, this time in Baltimore and D.C.

DAN
Truckers...?

WOMAN
Yeah, the roadblocks, security... I don't think we're going to see any
investment in transport until the political situation cools off.

DAN
Oh. I thought we had Stanley in the bag.

JC DENTON
I'm serious. I want you to tell me what you know about the stolen Ambrosia.

DAN
You misheard, officer. We were talking about work.

JC DENTON
I heard "Ambrosia."

DAN
I said you heard wrong.

WOMAN
Excuse us -- we're having a conversation.
I said leave us alone.
Get lost.

CONVERSATION: JORDAN SHEA

JORDAN
What can I get you?

JC DENTON
You work here; you must know the area. Heard of an old warehouse with an illegal
power generator?

JORDAN
Not exactly, but if you're looking for a warehouse, you should probably start in
the warehouse district.

JC DENTON
Where's that?

JORDAN
A few blocks south, not a bad walk, but the riot police have blocked the roads
because of the NSF.

JC DENTON
I'd like to check it out.

JORDAN
Well you may be out of luck. Even though one of the old warehouses faces onto
the park, I don't know how you'd get inside.

JC DENTON
Sounds like a good place to start.

JORDAN
Something to drink? Everything in the bar, snacks too, just ten credits.

JC DENTON
That's some heavy augmentation.

JORDAN
Yeah. Ex-UNATCO, what's it to you?

JC DENTON
I'm in the business.

JORDAN
Well, I was in an early program, okay? I can still polish a glass. Good luck
with your "business."
(That’s fine if the police have to ask some questions, but don’t terrorize my
customers.
You supposed to drink when you’re on duty?
Yes, Agent?)
Shoot.

JC DENTON
A beer, please.

JORDAN
There you go.
What'll it be?

JC DENTON
I'll take a candy bar.

JORDAN
There you go.
The tap's out. Only bottles.

JC DENTON
How 'bout a soda?

JORDAN
You better get rid of some gear if you want to carry anything else.

CONVERSATION: PILOT GUY (JOCK)

JC DENTON
Mind if I ask you a few questions?

JOCK
Hey, you look like the vigilante type. What if I said where you could load up on
military hardware?

1.  JC DENTON
    Where's that?

JOCK
That's valuable information. You'll have to come up with some kind of payment.
How about liquor?

JC DENTON
I don't have any liquor.

JOCK
The bar's to my left.
What do you have for me?

JC DENTON
You can have this bottle of liquor.

1.1
JOCK
That one's warm. Get me something from the bartender.

1.2
JOCK
I want one of Shea's ice-cold brown bullets. You too cheap to buy?

1.3
JOCK
What am I? A bum? You think I'm gonna drink anything you find lying around?

1.4
JC DENTON
You can have this beer.

JOCK
That'll do. His name's Smuggler. A real paranoid nut; wires himself in with
boobytraps. But he knows things; there's stuff in the sewers that only Smuggler
knows about.

JC DENTON
Thanks. Maybe I'll pay him a visit.

JOCK
Now I'll tell you something you can't hear from anybody but me.

2.  JC DENTON
    You mean that guy Smuggler across the street?

JOCK
Already know him? Too bad. Hey, how about I tell you something you can't hear
from anybody else.

JC DENTON
What's that?

JOCK
Area 51. You heard of it, right?

JC DENTON
Actually, I'd rather hear whether you know anything about a warehouse with an
illicit generator.

JOCK
I worked out there. Most people think they've got aliens from another planet,
but I didn't see any flying saucers. You want to hear about it, I'll tell you --
for the price of a beer.
What do you have for me?

JC DENTON
You can have this beer.

JOCK
I appreciate it. Yep, I know for a fact it's not just for government research.
I've seen all kinds of executives coming and going.

JC DENTON
I'm sure plenty of bureaucrats fly out there.

JOCK
Billionaires. Big executives. I think the whole place has been taken over by a
private corporation.

JC DENTON
Not likely.

JOCK
Something's going on underground. I'm a pilot, which means I didn't get access
to the main complex, but a lot of rock comes out of there; it's some kind of
mine. But what I don't understand is why they're always laying more fiber-optic
cables.

JC DENTON
A pilot? What do you fly?

JOCK
Copters. You know what I think? I think that's where the UN moved Echelon IV,
back when they promised they were going to stop spying on people.

JC DENTON
Surveillance is a very distributed technology. To centralize it in one large
facility would be very unusual -- even for the U.N.

JOCK
I bet they did it. They want to centralize everything -- every computer on the
planet.

JC DENTON
Know anything that's worth the price of a beer?

JOCK
This old bird's had enough. Hell, I'm about to go on duty.

JC DENTON
What kind of chopper pilot starts work at midnight?

JOCK
You're with UNATCO, right?

JC DENTON
Why do you ask?

JOCK
I'm the one that flies your brother Paul to Hong Kong. He told me to watch out
for you.

JC DENTON
I didn't know UNATCO hired pilots.

JOCK
The black choppers are run by the NSA to support various classified operations.
The Pentagon uses them, the CIA... They hired me because I don't ask any
questions.

JC DENTON
What was Paul's assignment in Hong Kong?

JOCK
Like I said, I know how to keep a secret -- even between brothers.

JC DENTON
So he's holding something back -- the reason UNATCO transferred him back to the
States.

JOCK
Listen to your brother, JC. Respect his experience. Let's leave it at that.
Your brother's one of the bravest men I know.
I sure hope Paul knows what he's doing.
Check out the girl in the leather top.
One thing the Air Force never understood: I'm dependable. No matter what, I'm
dependable.

JANEY

JANEY
Actually, it's my friend. Johnny took her into the alley west of here, across
the street.

JC DENTON
Slow down. Who's Johnny?

JANEY
I've got a bad feeling about this. He was mad. He gets crazy when he's mad.

JC DENTON
Don't worry. I'll check it out.

JANEY
He took me there once, and that's when I got cut.
I hope she's okay.
If Johnny touches her, I swear to God I'll kill him.

CONVERSATION: USED CAR SALESMAN? (JOE GREENE)

JOE GREENE
Joe Greene, Midnight Sun. Glad to know you. What can you tell me about what's

JC DENTON
Sorry. Regulations prevent me from talking to the press.

JOE GREENE
Regulations, eh? So you ARE part of the crackdown.

JC DENTON
Like I said, I have nothing to say.

JOE GREENE
Too stylish for the National Guard, too athletic for NYPD -- you must be from
UNATCO.

JC DENTON
I really can't be bothered right now.
How about I ask you a few questions?

JOE GREENE
Splendid. I certainly would like to know what an international antiterrorist
organization expects to find in a dive like this.

1.  JC DENTON
    Heard anything about a secret NSF power-generator?

JOE GREENE
Aha-a-a. Playing the detective, are we? I take it you've been assigned to
eliminate certain weapons systems... defenses, maybe? Am I getting warm?

JC DENTON
Just answer the question.

2.  JC DENTON
    On second thought, I don't need your help.

JOE GREENE
Then let me ask YOU a question. What do YOU think about the summary executions
happening on the very streets of New York?

JC DENTON
I'd call it civil unrest.

JOE GREENE
Let me be more pointed. How does it feel to be ordered to murder civilians just
because they support the fastest-growing political movement in this nation's
history?

JC DENTON
In a democracy, armed rebellion is criminal, not political.

JOE GREENE
Rebellion, as the Declaration of Independence tells us, is not only our "right"
but our "duty" when we have suffered "a long train of abuses and usurpations."
This is gonna make a great story.
Keep me updated.
Don't worry. I'll say "sources within UNATCO" if I quote you.

You can't touch JoJo. He doesn't go out, and there's only two ways to the

JC DENTON
Warehouse?

SANDRA
You think you can sneak into Osgood's at the park, but in the first place it's
locked...

JC DENTON
It looks like the fighting in the park has died down.
(The park? Where UNATCO has the NSF pinned down?)

SANDRA
...and if you go underground he's got laser tripwires, drone guns -- military-

Chinese Lunar Mine Operational
APR - Beijing, China

Chinese authorities today announced that their state of the art Zhou Enlai Lunar
Mining Complex is operational and functioning at one hundred percent capacity.
"We are pleased to be making significant progress not just in pushing back the
boundaries?of exploration for all humanity, but in developing the lunar
territories in a way that benefits the Chinese people and the global market,"
said Nghia Lam, Chinese Premier.
While the United States and Nigeria still dispute China's claims to the
lucrative Palus Somnii and Mare Crisium regions, Chinese construction has
proceeded apace while diplomatic negotiations continue. "We feel we have some
valid claim to those territories, certainly," said Robert Holden, Secretary of
the Interior for the U.S. "But we would prefer to find and equitable arrangement
that would allow our countries to work together in developing man's first real
home outside of our own planet."
The first ore delivery from the factory will be launched by mass driver tomorrow
and should arrive in Earth orbit by next week.

The Reluctant Dictators
by Travis Crockett

Introduction
Organized at the end of the American Revolution on May 13, 1783, by General
George Washington, the Order of the Cincinnati was ostensibly formed as a
fraternity to recognize the accomplishments of those officers who had served
with distinguishment during the Revolution. However, the true purpose of the
Order was the cultivation of a military force ready, willing, and able to
accomplish a coup d'etat if the fledgling American democracy began to stumble.
Skeptical at the viability of the untried democratic system, Washington took
counsel in the story of the Roman general Cincinnatus who was called from
retirement to serve as Dictator for sixteen days in the defense of Rome, after
which he returned home to his farm. In the wake of the Revolution, the United
States was vulnerable to any number of outside forces, and Washington felt that
a strong, central authority had to be present that could assume control of the
government if necessary -- and "temporarily" suspend the Constitution if
required.
Washington resigned as President after only two terms in office, but remained
President of the Order of the Cincinnati till his death. The Order still exists
to this day, a shadow organization of the wealthy and powerful that has been
linked to any number of other organizations ranging from the Illuminati to the
Trilateral Commission...

No, no more talking. If you see her, tell her I don't care what she's been

JC DENTON
I'll tell her she can trust you.

There are two of those guys. I knew they were NSF from the body-armor.
They're scared. That's why they took hostages.
Maybe we should just keep out of the way until this blows over.

CIA Factbook 2050: Hong Kong

Economic Overview: In the decades since Hong Kong has been returned to Chinese
control it has seen its economy thrive under the newly resurgent authority of
the Chinese central government. Led by a thriving technological market in human
augmentation technology, the real GDP has peaked every year since 2041 with all
forecasting models predicting that this trend will continue well into the next
decade if not beyond.
However, the statistics do not present an entirely accurate depiction of the
state of the Hong Kong economy as they fail to depict the flourishing gray and
black market that operates with at least the tacit approval of the Beijing
regime. While political oppression continues to present a major and ongoing
problem to those living under Chinese rule, entrepreneurism is alive and well in
the form of organized crime -- as has always been the case, anything and
everything can be had for a price in Hong Kong. Many of these criminal
organizations can trace their lineage directly to the Triads that have existed
for thousands of years throughout China and Southeast Asia...

Jacob's Shadow
by Andrew Hammond

Chapter 12

"Lot a people say this city looks like Hell," Allie said. She took a long drag
from her cigarette. The glowing tip burned like a hole in the darkness.
"Most people never been to Hell," Jacob said.
She looked at him and he could hear the smile in her voice. "And I suppose you
have?"
Jacob said nothing, then stood and walked to the bed. Allie let out a small
noise and shrank back against the pillows as if she'd claw her way into them if
she could. He leaned down close to her ear.
"You like to play games," he whispered. "And that's fine. But you don't want to
be playing games with me, because I'm the one honest man in this city. You
should know that, since we were married."

Vishnu's Fall
A Brief History of the Indian Crisis

...after the bombing, Indian officials issued a series of stern warnings to
Pakistan that were rebuffed with denials of responsibility and dire threats that
any attempt to use the bombings as a pretext for military action would be met
with force in kind. From the viewpoint of the present-day historiographer this
was a crucial event, a game of brinksmanship that had been played between
Pakistan and India many, many times before and so, while tragic, it is also
easily understood how clear signs of the impending catastrophe might have been
ignored.
"Like two kids shoving each other on the playground," said historian Alistair
Brooks. "You never expect them to come to blows."
That was before Pakistan began the trials of the "Calcutta 16" and both nations
descended into a maelstrom of political upheaval that would eventually culminate
in the exchange of nuclear warheads...

Bellevue Reports Increase in Admittance
New World Press - New York

Bellevue Hospital has reported a 50% increase in the number of patients admitted
over the last three months compared to this same period last year. "A disturbing
trend," said Dr. James Cabell, "and one that's stressing our personnel to the
limits. Many of those admitted are homeless that the police can't or won't deal
with -- some of them afflicted with the Gray Death. We simply don't have the
facilities to deal with those cases, and most of the hospitals refuse to accept
them."
Many have linked the outbreak of mental illness to the recent rise in
recreational drug use, in particular the new designer drug "zyme." Speaking on
condition of anonymity, one public official said that "Zyme has simply become a
threat to the public welfare . . . there have already been discussions with
Washington on a zero-tolerance solution."
Others have suggested chemical contamination could be the culprit, sighting the
recent chlorine spill that has rendered the East River almost lifeless.

Thomas,
Another week, another report. The triage situation here is getting tight -- so
many people with the Gray Death, and we simply can't help them. At best, we give
them fluids and attempt to keep them hydrated until they crash-out, but that's
just taking up space we could use for someone treatable. A lot of them have
nowhere to go, no... social support, and they're creating problems in the clinic
-- security is virtually non-existant and a few times I've had to tranq someone
and drag them back out onto the street.
Secondary diseases on the rise: lots of tetanus, gangrene, resistant infections,
advanced flu, that sort of thing. I've attached a detailed spreadsheet with a
break down and supply req. That's another thing: we missed last week's supply
shipment, and we're getting low on
Christ, I think they're shooting outside. I've got to go. Do what you can and
let me know what to expect.

Chlorine and Water Treatment:
Report for the New York City Council, 2053

...on the other hand, opponents claim chlorine compounds can cause cancer,
infertility, or birth defects. However, recent research indicates that the
increased risk of cancer from chlorinated water is minimal or nonexistent.
For example, a 2034 toxicological study found no carcinogenic effects at
chlorine concentrations a thousand times higher than the Environmental
Protection Agency revised Kyoto standards. And the International Agency for
Research on Cancer concluded population studies on cancer rates were too flawed
to draw any conclusions.
Water chlorination is just one target for some activists; they advocate
eliminating some or all of the 15,000 chlorine compounds now in use. This would
include more plastics, almost 85 percent of pharmaceuticals, and 96 percent of
crop-protection chemicals.
Yet most of the chlorine in the world occurs naturally. The annual global
emission of some 1,500 naturally occurring chlorinated organic chemicals totals
five million tons, compared to human emissions of chlorine compounds of only
26,000 tons...

I don't know. They're private security for a biotech company or something. They
have me doing antibody work.

JC DENTON
Corporate security isn't usually outfitted to fight a ground-war.

They're doing experiments on people. They don't want anybody finding out.

The soldiers kidnap homeless people and inject them with Gray Death.

The soldiers seemed less interested in curing the plague than in successfully
integrating it into a human host.

I could eliminate the immune response by removing all sequences that code for H
type epsilon, but that's like driving a nail with a wrecking ball.

Giant Rat Stalks New York?

NEW YORK -- In recent weeks a rash of mutilated corpses -- many of them found
near docks, subways, or sewers -- had garnered nothing but indifference from the
NYPD. "Isolated and unremarkable" in the words of one police spokesperson. But
while the police seem content to categorize these horrible crimes as nothing
more than simple cases of homicide or suicide among the poor and indigent,
eyewitness accounts tell a different and all together more frightening story.
"'is a monster, 'nnit?" says Dickie Cork, a sailor aboard the Matilda Briggs out
of Sumatra. "Thing looked like a rat, it did, only it was big, 'bout the size of
a lion or sumthin'."
Numerous other witnesses all telling remarkably similar accounts of the creature
have come forward in recent weeks, but the police refuse to act calling the
descriptions "ludicrous" without any further investigation. But regardless of
the truth, the police choose to sit idly by as the killings continue and poor,
law-abiding citizens pay the price. -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer

biological warfare agents would likely cause significant impacts on the medical
care system. Massive numbers of patients and demands for intensive care would

Let's be sensible. We have to look at the whole record.

OFFICIAL
Look, I understand. He was your pet project. But it's out of my hands. Now that
the shipment's been lost...

MANDERLEY
I know. I know; I will comply with the order.

That's all that I ask. Carry on. I'm going downstairs to interrogate the
prisoners.

Mr. Manderley can see you now.
You're going to make a mess.
Hey, I'm trying to work!
What's the idea, JC?

I am next.
I am losing valuable time.
A little more decorum, please.

Carry on, Agent.

Agent Denton, at your service.

Denton... Yes, I hear you're turning out to be quite an asset to the Coalition.

JC DENTON
Doing my best, sir. Forgive me, but I do not believe I know your name.

We aren't ready for an introduction yet. No, it's not time... Just keep your
nose to the pavement. You will be well rewarded. Trust me.
We're looking to you to set an example.
You aren't needed, Agent.
Manderley will give you your orders.
I must attend to a sensitive matter.
I have an important matter to attend to.

CONVERSATION: JOSEPH MANDERLEY & ANNA NAVARRE

MANDERLEY
Hello, JC. Come in. Clerical tasks first. Your op bonus is split between the
Castle Clinton and warehouse objectives, 500 each. You get the full 1000 -- plus
200 for how you handled the hostage situation in the Battery Park subway
station. Good work across the board.

JC DENTON
Thank you, sir. Who was that you were meeting with?

MANDERLEY
Politics. Bureaucracy. Mismanagement. JC... I've got some bad news. The mission
failed.

JC DENTON
I would have taken out that JoJo punk, but he wasn't in the warehouse.

MANDERLEY
Never mind that. He slipped out before you even got to New York.

JC DENTON
What about the shipment?

MANDERLEY
I'm just going to say it straight, JC. Your brother screwed up. We got nothing,
and he's taking the heat this time. The Coalition is letting him go.

JC DENTON
What went wrong?

MANDERLEY
We don't know. He hasn't reported back. The rest of the strike force says he
lost his nerve.

JC DENTON
I can't believe that. Paul's a good agent.

MANDERLEY
Whatever the case, now it's your turn. We've got one more chance to retake that
shipment.

JC DENTON
Has it been located?

MANDERLEY
Take the chopper back to the city. We know they plan to put the Ambrosia on a
plane, but we don't know which airfield.

JC DENTON
Where should I start?

MANDERLEY
If I were the NSF, I'd be moving through the subways, the abandoned parts of the
infrastructure.

JC DENTON
I'll check out the subways.

MANDERLEY
And stay away from the press this time, especially the tabloids. Do I need to
quote the manual? "Secrets are lives."

JC DENTON
Yes, sir.

ANNA NAVARRE
I have been waiting for twenty minutes.

MANDERLEY
Sorry, Anna. What is it?

ANNA NAVARRE
A new assignment. I think Agent Denton should handle the assassination.

MANDERLEY
Is there a problem? You lost your appetite?

ANNA NAVARRE
His enthusiasm in Battery Park was exceptional. The courtyard of Castle Clinton
was a graveyard.

MANDERLEY
Hmmmm. As a kind of exercise, you mean?

ANNA NAVARRE
I think he will make a good assassin. We should give him the opportunity.

MANDERLEY
Hmmmm.

ANNA NAVARRE
I am anxious to see one of the experimental agents perform.

MANDERLEY
You aren't alone, Anna.
Our pilot Jock is waiting for you at the helipad.
If you see your brother, send him my way. He didn't report back.
Don't forget to check in with Carter and Reyes.
You have your orders.
Let me get back to work.
I said carry on.

ANNA NAVARRE
You have your orders from Mr. Manderley.
Stop clowning around, Agent.
Get moving.
I refuse to babysit a grown man.
Why are you still here?

Art of War
by Sun Tzu

III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM

1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take
   the enemy's country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
   So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture
   a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them.
2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence;
   supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.

As ordered, I have maintained a close watch of Agent Denton during our operation

Righteous Angels: Perspectives on UNATCO
by Wendi White

Chapter II. The New Seraphim
As the giddiness that greeted the new millenium faded to grim apathy in the face
of the plague, famine, and the inevitable waves of national convulsions that
followed in their wake, the United Nations found itself increasingly outmoded
and unable to cope with the worldwide rise in terrorism. Tensions between the
affluent -- walled away within private enclaves -- and those less fortunate
escalated rapidly as basic medical care facilities collapsed under the weight of
each new outbreak. The very pervasiveness of the Net fractured communities into
smaller and smaller special-interest groups. And as local police grew
increasingly ineffectual and access to deadlier weaponry more commonplace,
conflicts spilled over national borders and onto the streets of major urban
cities.
The United Nations was forced to admit that their own military was both outmoded
and unequipped to deal with these threats, so a new organization was required --
UNATCO, an army of seraphim, divinely charged to mete out impartial justice with
burning wings and flaming swords...

BULLETINS

Stopping Terror -- A New Perspective on Freedom

When one maniac can wipe out a city of twenty million with a microbe developed
in his basement, a new approach to law enforcement becomes necessary. Every
citizen in the world must be placed under surveillance. That means sky-cams at
every intersection, computer-mediated analysis of every phone call, e-mail, and
snail-mail, and a purely electronic economy in which every transaction is
recorded and data-mined for suspicious activity.
We are close to achieving this goal. Some would say that human liberty has been
compromised, but the reality is just the opposite. As surveillance expands,
people become free from danger, free to walk alone at night, free to work in a
safe place, and free to buy any legal product or service without the threat of
fraud. One day every man and woman will quietly earn credits, purchase items for
quiet homes on quiet streets, have cook-outs with neighbors and strangers alike,
and sleep with doors and windows wide open. If that isn't the tranquil dream of
every free civilization throughout history, what is?
-- Anna Navarre, Agent, UNATCO

Terrorism -- War Without Fronts

How do we fight an underground threat, one with no defined territory, base, or -

- often -- known leader? We look to military history.
  The casebook example of how to manage civil unrest is the Hamlet Evaluation
  System (HES) developed by the United States military during its occupation of
  South Vietnam in the 20th Century. Since population centers in that country
  contained both Communist rebels and loyal citizens, the towns were ranked on a
  scale from 1 to 5, five being the safest. The monthly reports of local
  commanders, useful in Vietnam for maintaining contour maps of ideology
  concentration, have provided many components of the UNATCO Sector Field Report.
  The modern UDU (UNATCO Deployed Unit) has been modeled on the CAP (Combined
  Action Platoon) deployed in Vietnam, a 15-man rifle squad responsible for a
  single hamlet. CAP-protected villages typically earned a 2.95 HES score,
  compared to a 1.6 average in the same region. CAP units performed in many
  mission roles, but they primarily worked with indigenous police to strengthen
  ideological ties. Like CAP units, UNATCO teams are primarily concerned with
  building safe communities.
  -- Joseph Manderley, Director, UNATCO

Know Your Enemy -- Templars

There is some debate as to whether the Templars should be considered a
"terrorist" organization because they do not employ the typical tools of
terrorism. But make no mistake, the Templars are just as dangerous as any other
group that might use guns and bombs to intimidate the free citizens of a country
-- only the Templars wield blackmail and extortion as their weapons. Supposedly
the direct descendent of a so-called "secret society" with its roots in the
medieval Crusades, the present-day Templars are mainly concerned with increasing
their own bank accounts in elaborately illegal financial manipulations that have
left entire markets collapsed in their wake.
The Templars are currently classified as inactive after being successfully
diminished by a combined UNATCO/Interpol raid on their Paris headquarters in
2051; however, several key Templar figures are still at large and may attempt to
reform the organization under a new designation.

Know Your Enemy -- X-51

Little is known about "X-51" aside from their involvement in all manner of
illegal research, much of it proscribed by worldwide concordes over the last
fifty years. Computer profiling shows a high likelihood that X-51 was
responsible for the SoCal disaster that submerged much of southern California,
though the exact nature of the experiment that led to the tragedy is still
unknown. Little other information is available on the overall objective of X-51,
if any exists.
X-51 is believed to be led by Gary Savage, a scientist previously employed by
the United States government for a variety of black projects until he
disappeared under mysterious circumstances several years ago. All agents are
advised to be vigilant for any indications as to the whereabouts of Savage or
other members of X-51, and report them immediately to their operator or
immediate superior.

Subject: Mission Objectives

Of primary importance in the upcoming operation is recovering _all_ of the
stolen Ambrosia -- if any falls into terrorist hands, it could be a potential
tool for blackmail that would pose a serious security risk.
However, our best intelligence indicates that Juan Lebedev -- a known terrorist
leader -- is behind this galling attack; while the loss of the Ambrosia is a
regrettable salvageable incident, Lebedev poses a continuing threat to UNATCO.
He is also a dangerous man, and if the operation should result in his
termination rather than capture, there is no doubt that the agent responsible
would be found acted appropriately and with the full force of the law.

They won't talk. We've tried everything.
I won't say anything if you go back there.
I think Mr. Simons wants to be alone with the prisoner.

OFFICIAL
I have one question.

PRISONER
They already asked. I DON'T know.

OFFICIAL
One must admire a man who can keep a secret, because he has value. What you know
more than others makes money and gives you a measure of power.

PRISONER
You Walton Simons? You think I can be bribed?

OFFICIAL
Margaret Forsythe, under NSF protection in Queens. Your son Richard, attending
Bronx Science. You see, I have a few relevant facts myself. Care to make a
trade?

PRISONER
You wouldn't dare...

OFFICIAL
I'll give you two seconds to decide.
Get out of here, Denton. This is none of your business.
Time's up. Where is the NSF taking the Ambrosia?

PRISONER
They asked me already. I DON'T know.

OFFICIAL
Need I remind you that in the case of a national emergency FEMA has a list of
six million Americans who will be transported to detention centers? Your
tabloids call it RX 84.

PRISONER
Yeah, including the President, Congress, and the Supreme Court.

OFFICIAL
In my position, I find it very easy to add names to that list.

PRISONER
Go to hell.
The United States government has had "emergency powers" since World War II.
We've never left a state of war.

OFFICIAL
Speak for yourself. The federal government is just responding to a threat.

PRISONER
A government should be about more than self-perpetuation.

OFFICIAL
You will confess, by the way. I don't like to dirty my hands with that sort of
thing, but you will confess.
Certain intellectual properties, aside from the quantities of vaccine, concern
me deeply. Has the NSF made any attempt at reverse-engineering?

PRISONER
Leave me alone.

OFFICIAL
If you wanted to save people, you could have unloaded the whole shipment in
Manhattan. Why the airlift?

PRISONER
You said it yourself: secrets are power.

OFFICIAL
We have less civilized ways of making you talk.
I am a patient man.

But not that patient.
You saw nothing, Denton. Report to Manderley.

The real plague, eating at the minds of the American people, is secessionism,

"Hell is murky," that's what Macbeth said.

- They came through today, bunch of the NSF boys, set up a perimeter in the shanty

  necessary, that the government made it necessary -- "we're slaves if we don't,"
  I remember her saying, and I asked her if she thought those people down in the
  station felt any more free for being strapped to a bunch of dynamite. She just
  looked at me, walked away.

    Sorry I didn't need your help on the island. I hope it wasn't a wasted trip.

FILBEN
No sweat, man. I got paid. That's what matters.

JC DENTON
A real patriot.

FILBEN
I see it like this. It all balances out. UNATCO's just as much gun freaks as the
militias, and if everybody's gonna shoot it out, fine, so long as neither side
wins and takes over the whole country.

JC DENTON
The goal of UNATCO is not conquest. It's the safety of ordinary people like
yourself.

FILBEN
I know an army when I see one. Look, I'll be blunt -- got any cash? There's a
secret passage behind that phone booth over there. For 500, I'll tell you where
to get the code.

1.  (JC DENTON
    I'm not interested.

FILBEN
Change your mind?)

JC DENTON
Sure. 500 for where I can find the code to the phone booth.

FILBEN
Talk to Curly in the shantytown in Battery Park. He's from the mole-people
settlement. You have to give him the password "Underworld."

JC DENTON
I think I talked to the guy. He said the NSF were hiding out with the moles. Are
they allies?

FILBEN
They both hate the Feds, but that's it. The moles don't want a war. They just
want to be left alone in their tunnels.

JC DENTON
Aiding and sympathizing -- just as bad as being a terrorist yourself, in my
opinion.

FILBEN
I doubt the NSF gave them much choice.

2.  JC DENTON
    I already got the code to the phone booth -- but thanks.

JC DENTON
We think they're loading the Ambrosia onto a plane. Heard anything about that?

FILBEN
Nothing I could put a price on. UNATCO already thinks it's Juan Lebedev.

JC DENTON
Lebedev?

FILBEN
I don't know who else it could be. He owns a whole terminal at LaGuardia.
Manderley's been trying to bump him off for years.

JC DENTON
Since when is LaGuardia for sale?

FILBEN
City had some debts a few years back. There's always a buyer. But Lebedev's
small-time. He can't buy off the big politicians like a Bob Page.

JC DENTON
Who does he buy off?

FILBEN
People lower down, but useful. Some of your buddies at UNATCO, actually.

JC DENTON
Who?

FILBEN
Ah-ha-ha. You can't afford that one.
Yeah, if it's Lebedev, you're gonna have a chance to be a hero. Manderley wants
him dead.
Figured you'd come through here.
You want to know something, find me.

After the quakes, the homeless drifted down here, junkies, runaways, grifters.
There's a DSS file a mile long on this place. Some of them -- the so-called

HOMELESS
You don't want to camp with THEM. Trust me, they're too political.

JC DENTON
I don't need a place to camp.

HOMELESS
I STARTED the mole people. I was there first. And then they made up committees
that throw people out just because they don't like the way you look.

JC DENTON
How do I find them?

HOMELESS
Don't bother. They're elitist, and now the NSF is down there, too.
It stinks down there, anyway.
I'm a classic example of the individualist. I do better on my own.
The only thing about staying up here is the rooks. One time I was drunk and fell

CHARLIE

JC DENTON

CHARLIE
Well, the NSF come through here, but they don't bother us. If we need help with
anything, it's our plumbing. We lost pressure because of the explosions on South
Street.

JC DENTON
Tough break. You tell me about the NSF, and I'll put in a word with the city
about the water.

CHARLIE
The city don't know we got water and they don't NEED to know. How about you fix
it and then I'll talk.

JC DENTON
I don't have much time.

CHARLIE
I would open the valve myself, but there was a cave-in; the utility door's
blocked. It's up at the north end of the tracks, in case you want to take a
look.

JC DENTON
Clearing a tunnel -- that would require explosives.

CHARLIE
It could be done; a LAM would do the trick. It's just that I'm not gonna be the
one to talk to the Rooks. They'd probably sell us one, but they don't like
people going into their turf, which is the whole upper level.
I tried to clear a path to the door, but I'm not worth a nickel anymore.
The gang runs the whole upper level of the station.

JC DENTON
How do I get there?

CHARLIE
Go to the women's restroom on the other side of the station. Look for a keypad
under the sink. The combination's 5482.

JC DENTON
Great. I'm glad I could help you out.

EL REY
Sure, bro'. Yeah. Take it.

JC DENTON
Some gangbanger. Maybe you should think about going back to school.

EL REY
Juss be cool, bro'.
Thass it, bro'. You got my only one.
You didn't have to kill no one.

some explosives. Serious stuff, man.

JC DENTON
How much?

EL REY
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa -- We ain't talkin' firecrackers, understand. What I got, it
comes from a guy at UNATCO. Hardcore munitions and shit.

JC DENTON
How much?

EL REY
I got a LAM. Know what that is? 750.

JC DENTON
Pretty steep for second-hand goods.

EL REY
Either that, or you work for it. You into fighting? I need someone to take care

EL REY
Hot damn. That guy you just killed?

Guess it's not so bad if they manage to help some of the sick people.
If you're looking for the leader, he's in a secret room next to the storage area
beside us.
I tried to get away this morning, but I got caught. Then they shot my cat.
Like I said, I was just a prisoner. They didn't tell me much.

If you're looking for the airfield, you're gonna want to go to the north end of
the chamber. They've built a secret passageway in the men's bathroom.
I didn't want a fight, but I guess it turned out for the best.

Seasonal Flooding Minimal
APR - London, United Kingdom

An article recently published in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal
Meteorological Society indicates that worldwide flooding from melting ice caps
will be significantly less this year than in previous years due to an unusually
cold winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Dr. Tammy Bright, a professor of
climatology at Oxford University, led the study and noted that global tides
should rise by no more than "one to two meters on average" in most major cities
throughout North America, Europe, Russia, and East Asia. For comparison the high
water mark in New York last year was four meters, requiring millions of credits
in additional spending for a network of levees and pumps.
"While theories concerning the significant increase in days below freezing at
either pole abound, the practical upshot is that Arctic ice density has grown
substantially when compared to any similar period in the last five years."

McMoran Slings Chinese Ore
APR - Beijing, China

With the announcement by the Chinese last week that the Zhou Enlai Lunar Mining
Complex was fully operational, today McMoran Global Steel held a press
conference to detail the first delivery of lunar ore from the facility to Earth
via a mass driver constructed by McMoran.
"The McMoran MD-118 Mass Driver is the first piece of accelerated stock to be
constructed on such a scale, and certainly the first to operate
extraterestrially," said Sean Murphy. "The selection of McMoran for this
contract by the Chinese government is a major step towards closer economic ties
between China and the U.S."
McMoran won the contract in a heated bidding war with Page Industries that
reached its most fevered pitch when Page attempted an unsuccessful hostile
takeover of McMoran.

The Man Who Was Thursday
by G. K. Chesterton

...Syme had never thought of asking whether the monstrous man who almost filled
and broke the balcony was the great President of whom the others stood in awe.
He knew it was so, with an unaccountable but instantaneous certainty. Syme,
indeed, was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological
influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health. Utterly devoid of
fear in physical dangers, he was a great deal too sensitive to the smell of
spiritual evil. Twice already that night little unmeaning things had peeped out
at him almost pruriently, and given him a sense of drawing nearer and nearer to
the head-quarters of hell. And this sense became overpowering as he drew nearer
to the great President...

Jacob's Shadow
by Andrew Hammond

Chapter 15

Waiting was always the hardest part: in the stir, and in life. Guys who couldn't
handle it either ended up rocking back and forth in a dark corner, or babbling
incoherently. Always the same.
Jacob would have been the one rocking in the corner. He did solitary the first
time after fight, someone thinking he was an easy mark. Forty-eight hours and he
started screaming and didn't stop until his larynx was raw and his voice
cracked. It was a month before he could talk again.
One of the lifers saw Jacob wasn't as fence-post dumb as the rest of the
population and took to schooling him in chess. Jacob never got much respect from
the old-timer, but he got his sanity. He'd play chess, checkers, backgammon, any
game there was.
He got into another fight when one pendejo who was looking to make a name for
himself flipped over Jacob's game board, said impolite things about people and
their little kiddie games. Jacob cracked one of his ribs and amused himself for
a week in solitary playing Kasparov and Bobby Fischer in his head.

2.  PAUL DENTON
    Excellent work. I underestimated your abilities.

JC DENTON
You work for the NSF?

PAUL DENTON
Listen to what I've got to say. We don't have much time.

JC DENTON
You got that right. UNATCO will have a team here in a few minutes.

PAUL DENTON
The Gray Death is a man-made virus. Everyone up to the President is at UNATCO's
mercy as long as UNATCO controls the supply of Ambrosia.

JC DENTON
You believe that?

PAUL DENTON
We have proof. We need to get the Ambrosia to Hong Kong. Heard of Tracer Tong?
He can help us synthesize it ourselves.

JC DENTON
You better step away from the jet. Your boss is my next objective.

PAUL DENTON
Join us, JC. Talk to Lebedev. He can convince you.
Get on the plane. We're almost ready to go.

JC DENTON
Blackmail of the U.S. government could not possibly escape the notice of the
United Nations.

PAUL DENTON
Don't be so quick to trust the UN.

JC DENTON
Are you kidding? The UN's about the only chance we've got these days. If the
U.S. spirals into another Civil War...

PAUL DENTON
A pretext, nothing more. The whole project of world government -- going back to
the League of Nations -- has been funded and manipulated mainly by wealthy
bankers.

JC DENTON
Is that so?

PAUL DENTON
Remember that the UN itself was built on land donated by John D. Rockefeller.
Get on board. A UNATCO security squad will be here any minute.
The wealthy have always been the ones to profit from one-world government.
More later. You better get moving.
The United Nations' secret goal -- well, this is David Rockefeller's
description, from half a century ago: "the supernational sovereignty of an
intellectual elite and world bankers."
The UN was founded not to end war but to gradually dissolve national governments
and replace them with a Globalist meritocracy.
Average people never benefit from government and business on a scale they can't
even understand.
Go!

Black Helicopters a "Concern" Says Senator

As sightings of ominous "black helicopters" become increasingly common across
the country, from Manhattan to the SoCal shores, many citizens have grown
concerned that these gunships are actually a sign that troops may be preparing
to mobilize for some unknown action.
"Certainly this concerns me," said Senator Harry Jarvis (D-Texas), a member of
the Armed Services Committee. "I intend to bring this up in our next committee
meeting and ask some hard questions."
UNATCO director Joseph Manderley was more skeptical. "If black helicopters were
really being used for 'covert operations,' then those responsible are doing a
poor job of it." Manderley went on to say that UNATCO employed no such aircraft
and declined to pursue the matter any further claiming that it detracted from
the "serious nature of [our] mission." -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer

Decker let me know that Killian dropped off a canister recovered during the

2.  CONVERSATION: JUAN IVANOVICH LEBEDEV

LEBEDEV
I surrender!

JC DENTON
What?

LEBEDEV
Easy now, Agent. UNATCO has a policy against killing unarmed prisoners. We have
much to learn from each other.

JC DENTON
We're assuming control of the airfield. The vaccine will be returned to the
international authorities.

LEBEDEV
Don't you want to hear why your brother came over to our side?

JC DENTON
He makes his own decisions.

LEBEDEV
You know he wouldn't betray UNATCO without a reason.

CONVERSATION: ANNA NAVARRE

ANNA NAVARRE
Good work. Now finish the job.

JC DENTON
He surrendered. He's an unarmed prisoner -- UNATCO policy protects him.

ANNA NAVARRE
Terminate the prisoner, Agent. If you are too afraid, you are ordered to return
to base, on Manderley's authority. There is a helicopter waiting.
I have the command here now.
You are worthless if you cannot obey a simple order.
This man will receive a speedy trial.
Congratulations, Agent. You are one of us, after all. I confess I had my doubts.
Your helicopter is waiting at the airfield.
We can say what we like in the paperwork.
That is how it is done. Swift and quiet.
Good work. Now get to the helicopter.

3.  CONVERSATION: JUAN IVANOVICH LEBEDEV

JC DENTON
If you know something, just tell me.

LEBEDEV
The question you've got to ask -- I'm surprised you haven't -- is the obvious
one: Who am I? Who made me and for what purpose?

JC DENTON
UNATCO has briefed me on my augmentations. Get to the point.

ANNA NAVARRE
Return to base, Agent Denton. I will handle this.

LEBEDEV
Your parents were murdered precisely because they could have told you the
correct answer to that question.

JC DENTON
That's a pretty big claim.

LEBEDEV
You didn't have parents. The ones you knew were employees. You were made by a
cabal of technophiles so crazed for power that they would control not only
governments and people but the chemistry of our bodies as well.

ANNA NAVARRE
Leave us, Agent. Now.

JC DENTON
Sounds like a picture-perfect description of the NSF.

LEBEDEV
Think bigger, Agent. Think global.

ANNA NAVARRE
You have disobeyed a direct order.

LEBEDEV
Do you think it's an accident that the cure for the global plague is owned by a
single corporation, and that it's kept so secret that only the tabloids dare
print a story suggesting it exists?

JC DENTON
The supply is limited. That doesn't mean there's a conspiracy.

LEBEDEV
But where does that corporation manufacture the cure, and where did your brother
uncover the information that brought him over to our side?

JC DENTON
Go on.

LEBEDEV
I can tell by the expression of your friend's face that she knows where I'm
heading. UNATCO is completely correct to think that Tracer Tong will soon
understand Ambrosia. He was the one who was going to receive this shipment.

JC DENTON
Why tell me all this?

LEBEDEV
I've said nothing that UNATCO won't find on this plane's computer. But here's
the secret. This is what Paul was so interested to hear from Tracer Tong.

ANNA NAVARRE
Manderley will be disappointed in your insubordination.
That is what happens to a prisoner who tries to escape. Go to the helicopter
now, Agent Denton. It is waiting at the airfield.
Get to the helicopter. Manderley will want to see you.
I have never had this much difficulty with a trainee in my life.
I have told Manderley a thousand times: augmentations do not make an agent.

4.  CONVERSATION: JUAN IVANOVICH LEBEDEV

LEBEDEV
I guess Paul must have convinced you.

JC DENTON
All right. We're alone. If you have proof of a conspiracy, let's hear it.

LEBEDEV
The question you've got to ask -- I'm surprised you haven't -- is the obvious
one: Who am I? Who made me and for what purpose?

JC DENTON
UNATCO has briefed me on my augmentations. Get to the point.

LEBEDEV
Your parents were murdered precisely because they could have told you the
correct answer to that question.

You didn't have parents. The ones you knew were employees. You were made by a
cabal of technophiles so crazed for power that they would control not only
governments and people but the chemistry of our bodies as well.

JC DENTON
Your proof?

LEBEDEV
You're the proof. You and Paul. When you get back to UNATCO, pay attention.
Something's not right. You're really working for a group of conspirators called
Majestic 12.

JC DENTON
You expect me to believe there's a group of people powerful enough to control
the United Nations?

LEBEDEV
The U.N. and UNATCO are just a couple of their tools.
UNATCO has already occupied the airfield. Just go through the motions and report
back to Liberty Island. I can't do anything for you here.
Be patient. Someone will contact you, soon.
If you want to find out more, you'll have to contact Tracer Tong in Hong Kong.

Don't you think we should give Paul a chance to explain himself? He's been with
UNATCO for years.

GUNTHER HERMANN
Only one thing can happen when you break your oath to the Coalition.
I will be truthful. I have requested the assignment of the Paul Denton
assassination.
Again they ignore me. Again they think they have a better punishment for a

I will do it myself, even if they say to get him alive.

UNATCO Nabs Terrorists in Hell's Kitchen Raid
APR - New York

A recent raid on UNATCO's Liberty Island headquarters by members of the National
Seccessionist Forces (NSF) ended today when UNATCO troops, working in
conjunction with local police, assaulted the warehouse in Hell's Kitchen where
NSF units were regrouping. While UNATCO casualties were low, few NSF members
survived the action which UNATCO director Joseph Manderley termed a "suicidal
last stand on their part."
"We negotiated for hours," said Manderley, "and were prepared to make
arrangements for their surrender into custody when an attack was
initiated?against us by the NSF. We had no choice but to respond with force.
Obviously, a complete inquiry into this terrible, unfortunate series of events
will be undertaken as soon as possible."

Not if you pause for a second and think about who he was and what he stood for.

SAM CARTER
It's a shame when a difference of opinion gets somebody killed. That's all I
have to say about that.

JC DENTON
Every war is the result of a difference of opinion. Maybe the biggest questions
can only be answered by the greatest of conflicts.

SAM CARTER
Let's hope not, or we're on the brink of another world war. Speaking of which,
tell me what you need. I'll load you up.

2.  JC DENTON
    Not so good. I don't know who to trust anymore.

SAM CARTER
No one blames you about Lebedev. You refused an order to kill in cold blood --
precisely your duty as a UNATCO peacekeeper.

JC DENTON
Manderley certainly does.

SAM CARTER
He'll cool down. The important thing is that you obey your conscience.

JC DENTON
Right.

SAM CARTER
Tell me what you need, and I'll load you up.

1.  JC DENTON
    I'll take tranquilizer darts for the crossbow.

SAM CARTER
A man of tactics. I like that.

2.  JC DENTON
    I've been using a shotgun.

SAM CARTER
Working in close, huh? Takes guts.

3.  JC DENTON
    Sniper rifle, thirty-ought-six.

SAM CARTER
You learn fast -- I'm impressed.

4.  JC DENTON
    A GEP rocket.

SAM CARTER
Like the big guns, huh? Hang on to this baby. It's the last one I've got.

SAM CARTER
I hear they're shipping you out to Hong Kong. Hate to see you go.
Watch your back around the Triads.
It's a shame about Paul. He was one of the best.
Stop moping around, soldier.
I said move out.

Thanks for the e-mail -- sorry I haven't been to reply before now, but we've got
our hands full here. Everyone's working 24 by 7 trying to isolate the Gray Death
vectors. While things haven't been too bad down here in Atlanta (yet), the
reports I'm getting back from field operatives in NYC aren't as optimistic. I'll
send you the latest data as soon as I have it, but let me be perfectly honest:
the projections aren't good. Initial casualties could be up to 10% of the
current population, with another 3-5% mortally affected by secondary contagions.
If you've got any place to head on vacation, I'd go. Until then, if any of your
people come into contact with this stuff I'd say Level 3 quarantine is your best
option.
I've got to run, but I'll let you know as soon as all the data is in --

CONVERSATION: JAIME REYES & WALTON SIMONS

JAIME REYES
What kind of pain?

WALTON SIMONS
Behind the eyes. A sharp burning. Almost electrical.

JAIME REYES
How's your bioelectric level?

WALTON SIMONS
It's always at a hundred percent. I like to stay prepared.

JAIME REYES
That's probably it right there. Free radicals. You should charge your systems
only when they've been significantly drained.

WALTON SIMONS
I wasn't informed of that.

JAIME REYES
It's a lot like an electric razor. If you leave it plugged in all the time, the
battery loses its zero point. Just watch your levels.

WALTON SIMONS
Interesting. Thanks, Doctor.

JAIME REYES
Let me know how it goes.

JC DENTON
Get everybody patched up?

JAIME REYES
I did my best. You're looking good.

JC DENTON
Never felt better.

JAIME REYES
They just dropped off a few liters of the Ambrosia you recovered, by the way.

WALTON SIMONS
Good work out there, Denton. I want you to know: we will not let your brother's
activity cast its shadow on you.

JC DENTON
Yes, sir. I'm grateful for that. I just wish we'd found out sooner.

WALTON SIMONS
No harm done. We have you to take his place.

JC DENTON
Is a few liters going to be enough?

JAIME REYES
Well, no one on staff's gonna catch Gray Death this month.

JC DENTON
Paul said UNATCO uses the Ambrosia supply to influence national governments.
What do you think about that?

JAIME REYES
So it's true. He went over to the NSF.

1.  JC DENTON
    Yeah, he tried to recruit me.

JAIME REYES
What? You? Work for the NSF? Did he really expect you to believe that UNATCO's
part of some global conspiracy?

JC DENTON
I waxed his boss. Maybe he'll get the message.

2.  JC DENTON
    He makes some sense. I spared his boss, Juan Lebedev.

3.  JC DENTON
    He makes some sense. I ignored the mission objective of killing his boss, Juan
    Lebedev, but Agent Navarre intervened.

JAIME REYES
What did Manderley say?

1.  JC DENTON
    He boxed my ears. No big deal.

JAIME REYES
I'm surprised he didn't fire you on the spot.

JC DENTON
He gave me one more chance. I'm on my way to Hong Kong.

JAIME REYES
Good. Maybe you'll find out what got into Paul.

2.  JC DENTON
    I didn't talk to him yet.

JAIME REYES
You better get to his office. He's not going to like that one bit.

JAIME REYES
If there's a conspiracy it's at VersaLife; they're the ones making money off the
plague.
Whatever his politics, I'm still going to miss your brother. Tell him that if
you see him.
I don't think it will be long before VersaLife steps up production of the
vaccine.
Looks like the cleaner bots were busy while I was gone.
Busy day, but as you can see I got to everyone.
I can finally start on some paperwork.
As usual, take what you need.

WALTON SIMONS
I saw you listening in. Yes, it's true. I have augmentations like yours.

JC DENTON
Don't you work down in Washington?

WALTON SIMONS
Actually, I'm the Director of FEMA.

JC DENTON
Sounds like you wouldn't have much use for physical augmentations.

WALTON SIMONS
You underestimate the demands of my work. We deal with every sort of natural and
unnatural disaster you can imagine.

JC DENTON
But you're the director. You work behind a desk.

WALTON SIMONS
Am I behind a desk right now? No, I'm not. That's because we have a situation
here in New York. I got to my position because I can fix things. You will see
shortly, because as you have probably noticed yourself this agency is broken and
needs an overhaul.

JC DENTON
What do you mean by "overhaul"?

WALTON SIMONS
You will receive a memo in a few days. I am still collecting data.

JC DENTON
UNATCO was very effective this evening. We recaptured the shipment.

WALTON SIMONS
You don't have to worry, Agent. It's the softer elements I am after.

JC DENTON
Like who?

WALTON SIMONS
You're beginning to exceed your clearance. What are you, Angel/0A?

JC DENTON
Excuse my persistence. I'll wait for the memo.

WALTON SIMONS
Good. Carry on.
I said no more questions.
I have good reason to hold back the announcement.

NEWSPAPER

Ten Dead in Gang Slaying
APR - Hong Kong, China

The simmering gang war in Hong Kong exploded onto the streets overnight when ten
were killed during an attack on a local establishment, the Lucky Money Club.
Located in the Wan Chai district, the Lucky Money Club has generally been
associated with organized criminal activity. Eyewitness reports were few, but
local authorities suspect that members of the Luminous Path Triad may have been
involved in the attack.
All ten victims had extensive criminal records. Each was killed with traditional
weapons, their throats savagely cut in an ancient ritual typically employed as a
punishment for betrayal.

CONVERSATION: SALLY

SALLY
Hey, Mr. UNATCO man. You guys goin' after JoJo?

JC DENTON
I'm not going after anybody.

SALLY
That's pretty logical, him being hid out in the 'Ton.

JC DENTON
JoJo Fine of the NSF?

SALLY
The whole street's a UNATCO security zone. That's why they sent me down here.
They're gonna make that punk out and no one's gonna miss him.

1.  SALLY
    They said go to Battery Park, but I wanna be here to see JoJo hit the curb.
    He's always giving me trouble.
    Now JoJo's moved in on the Rentons. That ain't right.

2.  JC DENTON
    You can forget about JoJo. I left him on his back in the hotel.

SALLY
Really? That's it?

JC DENTON
He's not going to be a problem anymore.

SALLY
Does that mean the evacuation's over?

JC DENTON
You better stay here until the police say it's okay.

SALLY
I gotta use the street to get home.
They got JoJo. What more do they need to do?
Man, I can't believe that guy's dead. I've been dreaming about this day...
I can't wait to tell Janey.
Thanks, man. Really.

SMUGGLER
Hey, about your brother. If he's in Hell's Kitchen, he's a sitting duck.

JC DENTON

SMUGGLER
UNATCO's got this place nailed down. One thing they can't stand: an agent gone
AWOL.

JC DENTON
Maybe I should prepare for the worst. What do you have for me?

SMUGGLER
I have an extended clip that will fit most handguns and rifles for 1500 credits,
a range weapon-mod for 2400, and a napalm canister that fits most flamethrowers

Not interested.

Here's a tip for free: take cover. UNATCO's about to do a raid.
All they said was, "Clear out; we're coming in."
Good to see you UNATCO boys know how to clean up this town.
(In case you didn't know, some thug's taken over the 'Ton. Someone should take
care of him.)
I hear UNATCO's got a team going over the old NSF hideout. Probably put me out
of business.
By morning UNATCO'll know everything there is to know about the rebels.
I bet I wake up tomorrow and I don't have a job.

JOE GREENE
Perfect. Someone who can tell me about the raid.

1.  JC DENTON
    Like I said before, I don't talk to the press.

JOE GREENE
Why are they closing down the street and shutting down the bar? What could be
worse than the fighting earlier this evening?

2.  JC DENTON
    What I want to know is how my boss found out I talked to you.

JOE GREENE
You're the investigator. You tell me.

JC DENTON
I think one of us told him.

JOE GREENE
If I knew him, I wouldn't have to question you, now would I? Just answer one
thing: why are they closing the bar and clearing out the streets? What could be
worse than the fighting earlier this evening?

JC DENTON
I wish I had an answer to that, but even if I did it wouldn't be any of your
business.
How about I interview you? Tell me what you've dug up on the raid.

JOE GREENE
What's the matter? Did they leave you out of the loop?

JC DENTON
I'm the one asking questions.

JOE GREENE
Must be a high-level operation. I'd sure like to know what it is.

JC DENTON
All right, forget it. I'll find out on my own.

next base.

JC DENTON
UNATCO's looking for him. He worked for the NSF.

JORDAN
Far as I can tell, UNATCO doesn't give a damn about JoJo or the Rentons. Bigger
fish to fry, I suppose. What do you need?

2.  JC DENTON
    I already took care of that punk JoJo, if that's what you mean.

JORDAN
Really? He's dead?

JC DENTON
Surprised?

JORDAN
I'm just glad to see that someone gives a damn about the Rentons. UNATCO seems
to think they have bigger fish to fry.

JC DENTON
A bottle of booze, please.

JORDAN
Drink up. We're about to close.
So they brought you over for the raid? That's surprising.

JC DENTON
I'm not involved with any kind of raid.

Oh. Well, then you probably want to stay out of the crossfire. I just assumed...
So what do you need? Ten credits, anything in the house. Last call.

Thanks for the advice.

Best thing in these situations is to clear out. That's what we should've done

PAUL DENTON
(groans)

JC DENTON
Is this killswitch real? What's it going to do to you?

PAUL DENTON
I'm afraid that's classified.

JC DENTON
Manderley said you're going to die.

PAUL DENTON
You've got to have God clearance to... to know... The nanites can be programmed
for exponential growth.

JC DENTON
There's a chopper that can take us to Hong Kong. You know Jock?

PAUL DENTON
First... You're the only that can help. I need to send the NSF distress code.
UNATCO tracked Lebedev to the other NSF bases -- and to Silhouette in France.

1.  JC DENTON
    I came to get you out of here.

PAUL DENTON
JC -- you've got to believe me. UNATCO takes... payoffs. Silhouette -- the other
terrorist groups, they're our allies.

JC DENTON
You've done what you can for the rebels. Let's go.

2.  JC DENTON
    Go on.

PAUL DENTON
UNATCO takes payoffs. Silhouette -- the other terrorist groups, they're our
allies.

JC DENTON
I'm prepared to believe you. I killed Agent Navarre, and I'll join you against
UNATCO -- but I want proof.

PAUL DENTON
You want proof, pay a visit to the NSF headquarters. Down in the basement,
protected by boobytraps, a datacube sits on the edge of a table: my report to
the militia leaders. Here, I have a photograph of the building. It's a couple of
blocks to the west, behind the bar.

JC DENTON
And I suppose while I'm there you want me to encrypt a signal with the NSF
transmitter, bypass UNATCO SigInt...?

PAUL DENTON
A lot of people could die... my friend, Chad, for example, the leader of
Silhouette.

JC DENTON
I'll check out the facility, but I can't promise I'll help the terrorists. Be
ready to leave for Hong Kong when I get back.
You sure you're all right?

PAUL DENTON
Not worse than a bad cold. What kills me is just...

JC DENTON
That they have this kind of power.

PAUL DENTON
The power, yes, but the fact that it's been there from the beginning. A lot of
things are starting to make sense. You remember Mom and Dad?

JC DENTON
You think they knew?

PAUL DENTON
Lebedev thought so. He said they were employees of the United Nations.

JC DENTON
They would never have agreed to anything like a killswitch.

PAUL DENTON
Remember, I knew them longer than you did, and after what Tong showed me, I'm
pretty certain we don't have a stitch of DNA in common with either of our
supposed parents.
They've opened up the street behind the bar. The NSF base is on the other side
of the tunnel.
Silhouette's not much to speak of militarily, but you might call them the brains
of the resistance movement.
They go after public opinion. If it wasn't for Silhouette there'd be a half-
dozen meaningless civil wars going on instead of any kind of worldwide struggle.
Ironically, to fight the one-worlders, we ourselves have to become a global
organization.
It's been easier than we expected. Average people are beginning to wake up to
the fact that bigger isn't better.
A few bureaucrats in New York can't make good decisions for New Jersey, let
alone Paris or a village in China.
That kind of centralization can only lead to precisely the debacle that the UN
has become.
Somehow the notion of unalienable liberty got lost. It's really become a
question of what liberties will the state assign to individuals -- or, rather,
what liberties we will have the strength to cling to.
It's only a matter of time before someone clever and ambitious figures out that
the tools of dictatorship have been ready-made by well-meaning governments all
over the world.
UNATCO, for instance. A global response to a common problem. Looks good on
paper, but a global military force is hard to keep accountable.
UNATCO's already in the wrong hands; I don't know whose hands, but you'll find
records of outside influence if you dig around the NSF headquarters.
You better get moving.

BOOK

The Man Who Was Thursday
by G. K. Chesterton

"...First of all, what is it really all about? What is it you object to? You
want to abolish Government?"
"To abolish God!" said Gregory, opening the eyes of a fanatic. "We do not only
want to upset a few despotisms and police regulations; that sort of anarchism
does exist, but it is a mere branch of the Nonconformists. We dig deeper and we
blow you higher. We wish to deny all those arbitrary distinctions of vice and
virtue, honour and treachery, upon which mere rebels base themselves. The silly
sentimentalists of the French Revolution talked of the Rights of Man! We hate
Rights as we hate Wrongs. We have abolished Right and Wrong."
"And Right and Left," said Syme with a simple eagerness, "I hope you will
abolish them too. They are much more troublesome to me..."

Mind if I take a look around?

TROOP
Go right ahead.
I don't care what they say; Paul was a great agent. I hate to see him go.
By morning, you won't even know the terrorists were here.
We still haven't found what we're looking for.
Got to make my rounds, Agent.
We think there's a secret level below the base, but no one's sure.
Glad you could lend a hand.
The guys inside know more about what's going on.

You'll need to send the signal from the satellite dish on top of the warehouse.
If you're unable to hack the computers up there, you'll need the instructions
and account information Lebedev sent me. One of our agents, who tried to send
the signal but got run off, left the datacube in a secret area below the garage;
look for a hatch under some boxes. A computer on the third floor can unlock the
hatch.

CONVERSATION: UNATCO TROOP 1, UNATCO TROOP 2 & UNATCO TROOP 3

TROOP 1
You're not cleared to be up here, Agent.
Crime Scene Unit personnel only.
We will report this intrusion to Walton Simons.
This floor is off-limits.
Where do you think you're going, Agent?
We're supposed to defend this area with force, but I guess we'll let you pass.
You better have a good reason for being up here.

TROOP 2
Howdy, Agent. Guess you have the command now.
Just taking a break.
Maybe you can cut through the malarkey and get us out of here before morning.
From what I can tell, the NSF were fabricating records that said Walton Simons
was bribing people at UNATCO. Don't know what they expected to gain from doing
that.
All a bunch of nonsense.
I'm glad we cleaned this place out. They were riling people up with propaganda.

TROOP 3
Just keeping busy.
We've got a lot of work to do.
Turns out your brother was stealing balance sheets from UNATCO's accounting
department.
The civilian authorities will take over tomorrow.
I can't imagine what the rebels thought they'd find. A 10,000-credit toilet
seat?
The NSF sure put up a fight this time.
Pardon me, sir.
Someone should check out the roof.
I think we found all of the data.

DATACUBE

All:
I've released halon gas into the computer room to prevent any fires breaking out
in case of assault -- obviously, anyone entering the room unprotected will
suffocate. Use a hazmat suit, or pump out the gas before entering if you need to
perform any maintenance.

DATACUBE

Paul, I'm sending you this message from the plane -- UNATCO has been even more
ruthless than we'd feared, and the reports I'm receiving now are that our people
are being slaughtered in the tunnels; it's probably only a matter of time before
I'm captured or executed, and I don't doubt that they'll kill everyone they can
back at our headquarters. If you find this, you must get a message out to our
people. Align the communications dishes using the satellite dish control
computer -- the login is MCOLLINS and the password is REVOLUTION. Nearby is the
actual communications console; log in using NAPOLEON and the same password, and
a coded warning will automatically be bounced to everyone on our network.
I can hear the gunshots. They've reached the plane. I'm sorry I won't be able to
thank you in person -- you've done much for the peoples of the world.

CONTACT: PAUL DENTON

PAUL DENTON
You've got what you need to use the transmitter on the roof. Look around in that
room; you should find records of the bribes Manderley has been taking. Then get
to the roof, JC. I need you to send that distress signal.

DATACUBE

Juan, I have a feeling that -- one way or another -- my time here is short, and
I think my loyalties are already being questioned. The inevitable complications
from the raid are only going to raise more doubts, so I've pulled together
everything I could access without raising additional suspicions.
Attached you should find information linking Simons, Manderley, and other high-
ranking members of UNATCO through covert communications and a series of monetary
payments. If you check the records, over c10,000 a month is being placed into an
anonymous Zurich account routinely accessed by Manderley -- the payments were
slick, being dispersed through a number of shell companies and orbital banks,
but they all eventually originate with companies in which Simons has a
controlling interest if you follow the trail far enough back.
I also managed to document some of UNATCO's less than shining operations,
including their role in the Statue bombing. Most disturbing is further
verification of Tracer's suspicion that UNATCO may not only be involved with the
distribution of Ambrosia, but also with the Gray Death in some way.
I've given a copy of all this same material to Jock with orders to deliver it to
Tracer if things get as bad as I think they might. Be careful.

I've got to assist our forces at the airfield, but I've prepped the security

Erin is looking forward to seeing you again. Don't disappoint her.

you find the records we collected on that weasel, Walton Simons?

JC DENTON
I have a question about Simons. The instant I sent the signals, he ordered the
troopers to hunt us down. Why does FEMA have authority over UNATCO? I thought
FEMA was a domestic agency for flood relief and that sort of thing.

PAUL DENTON
His authority doesn't come from FEMA. He's part of a secret organization...
Majestic-12. We don't know much more than the name. They plan to use FEMA as
part of a scheme to shut down the U.S. government.

Terrorist Attack at La Guardia

The recent terrorist attack on Liberty Island and the resultant reprisal by
UNATCO forces appears to have spilled over onto a private airfield at La Guardia
Airport where fighting is still ongoing at last report. All inbound flights are
being rerouted to John F. Kennedy International Airport, while outbound flights
have been suspended until further notice. Look for further updates as more
information becomes available.

Page Donates to Area Clinics

Today Bob Page made a record donation of over ten million credits to the Clinics
and Hospices Association of New York, the largest private donation in the
organization's history. Already strained to the breaking point by the influx of
patients suffering from the "Gray Death," the donation was "a gift from God,"
according to Ray Cobo, Deputy Director of CHANY. "This couldn't have come at a
better time and should allow us to dramatically improve our services."
"It was the right thing to do," commented Page. "When I was in New York
recently, the suffering that I saw on the streets was unconscionable. Thomas
Aquinas, a personal icon, worked his entire life to ease such terrible pain.
This is the very least I could do."

Lab Notes, Dr. Moreau
Week of 4/12 to 4/18

Sunday, 4/12: LabNet accounts are disabled. Rumor is possible infiltration
attempt by Silhouette required redistribution of secure network resources. Will
transcribe lab notes by hard until IS has restored access.
Monday, 4/13: Greasels displaying an increasing level of antipathy towards lab
personnel. Noted to Dr. Verne who increased dosage of succinylcholine from 15cc
to 32cc.
Wednesday, 4/15: IS promises that LabNet accounts will be restored by Friday;
new login is "dmoreau" with password "raptor".
Thursday, 4/16: Dr. Cairns typically absent minded; forgot his protective gear
when handling greasel and received a dose of venomous spit in the face.
Fortuitous opportunity to study effects on human nervous system which included
impaired coordination and vision.

In addition to their standard 7.62mm firearms, short range rockets have been
added to their arsenal. Enhanced power armor utilizing heat-dispersing foam
insulation will greatly reduce damage from fire or plasma weaponry, while
ballistic shielding provides significant protection from small arms fire. An
integrated rebreather also renders them invulnerable to any aerosol or gas

PROSPECTUS: SERIES P AGENTS proposal by Dr. Arthur Donovan (VersaLife/HK)

The Series P agents are the logical continuation of research resulting from the
Series N: the development of a human agent with enhanced capabilities and
absolute loyalty, but without the non-standard appearance of mechanical
augmentation or the unpredictability of nano-augmentation. Like the Series N,
the strength and speed of the Series P should be substantially above baseline
while new conditioning techniques will result in minimal pain response. We
conservatively predict a Series P agent would be 78% more effective in combat
than a normal operative without any form of augmentation.
Key features from the Series N agent will also be carried over, including the
self-termination mechanism. An ingenious variation on the "kill-switch," the
self-termination mechanism is wired into the autonomous nervous system of an
agent. If mortally wounded, the mechanism will activate and explode, eliminating
any evidence of the agent and damaging nearby hostiles.
However, we are still continuing in our attempts to isolate the source of the
albino traits present ever since the Series L, but so far the simple addition of
sunglasses and dark clothing appear to have resolved the matter in a practical
fashion...

Surgical Pre-Evaluation
Subject: Paul Denton

...subject shows a number of departures from nominal baseline physiology,
including a noted absence of all H type epsilon immunoglobin proteins which
would seem to be related to his ability to tolerate nano-augmentations that are
typically rejected by the vast majority of the population. Of particular
interest is that the subject tests positive for the "Gray Death" yet shows no
apparent symptoms or adverse effects...

Okay, we have a deal. The login is MJ12; the password is Invader. As maybe you

JANINE'S BOTS
SPECS AND OVERVIEW
PAGE BRAVO-3 PEACEBRINGER

The Page Industries Bravo-3 Peacebringer is an affordable security and patrol
bot that combines a bipedal frame with an air-cooled mini-gun that utilizes the
7.62x51mm NATO round. While the AI is limited in its capabilities, it is more
than adequate to the needs of most security -- and many military -- forces
around the world, having been deployed in such troubled hot-spots as Hong Kong,
Chicago, New York, Buenos Aires, New Delhi, Moscow, and Paris. Like almost all
bots designed to maneuver in urban environments, the Bravo-3 employs a radar
imaging system for situational awareness, but unlike previous models in the
Peacebringer line the Bravo-3 is now equipped with a RazorThorn signal processor
for target acquisition. Organizations and facilities in need of heavier bot
armament often turn to the larger Delta-2 Peacebringer, equipped with thicker
armor and missiles...

UNATCO HANDBOOK: Appendix A
Origins of UNATCO

In recent years the swelling tide of international terrorism coupled with enmity
between states, wildly varying laws, and an anachronistic devotion to arbitrary
borders has resulted in the decreasing effectiveness of local law enforcement.
To resolve the problem, a neutral agency was required to enforce international
law in an impartial manner around the world.
UNATCO was formed with just such a mission in mind, an organization that could
transcend national boundaries and provide security for all nations that
subscribe to its charter. Founded with the principles of the United Nations as
its cornerstone, UNATCO is FAIR, JUST, and protects the individual liberties of
all the citizens of the world.
The criminal thrives on anonymity, but soon there will be no place for them to
hide. Victory over terrorism is the prize for our VIGILANCE.

ALL HONG KONG MJ12 PERSONNEL

Hong Kong is a unique environment for MJ12 personnel and provides a number of
challenges that all members should be aware of on a daily basis. Currently, only
tenuous ties exist between MJ12 and local authorities -- though MJ12 is working
to resolve that situation -- and consequently, police and security cannot be
expected to understand the special nature of MJ12's charter. Agents, operatives,
security, and other personnel should adhere closely to the Confidentiality
Guidelines outlined in your handbook.
One key factor in police response is the use of "acoustic gunfire sensors"
scattered throughout much of Hong Kong: cheap and effective, these sensors use
DSP circuitry to alert authorities to non-supressed (i.e. not silenced) gunfire.
That enables police to quickly minimize threat situations in an efficient
manner. While these sensors can be disabled, Central Operations does not
recommend this course of action, but rather a considered evaluation of any
tactical situation to avoid local intervention.

PROJECT DIBBUK
SH-187 Specifications and Operation
Domination/5F Clearance ONLY

...the goal of PROJECT DIBBUK was to create a long range, variable mission-
capable rotary aircraft, realized to its fullest extent in the SH-187 "stealth
helicopter." The production model SH-187 features a revolutionary engine powered
by HIGH-EFFICIENCY ETHANOL FUEL CELLS with a flight range of over 9000 miles
depending upon atmospheric conditions, and an extension of the thermoptic
camouflage technology that renders it INVISIBLE across 97% of the non-visible
electromagnetic spectrum. Ideally suited for surveillance, insertion, retrieval,
and limited interdiction, the SH-187 will often spend much of its operational
lifetime within hostile territory, and therefore is also equipped with REMOTE
DISABLING and scrambling for its key flight systems. If necessary, the vehicle
can also be scuttled remotely...

Mass Driver Accident Kills Over 2,000
APR - Ibadan, Nigeria

The historical first delivery of ore from the Zhou Enlai Lunar Mining Complex
ended in tragedy today when a targeting error resulted in the payload slamming
into the outskirts of the city of Ibadan in Nigeria. Thousands died in the
initial blast that was compared to a small nuclear bomb as the payload impacted
in a sparsely populated suburb, while thousands more were left disoriented,
homeless, and without power or water in the wake of the explosion.
Chinese officials have halted all other deliveries from the Zhou Enlai Complex
and are working with both the United Nations and officials from McMoran Global
Steel to determine the cause of the error. McMoran Global Steel was responsible
for the construction of the mass driver, winning the contract from Page
Industries in a heated bidding war.
"Obviously we took the utmost precautions in building the Zhou Enlai driver,"
said?spokesperson?Sean Murphy. "But something has gone terribly wrong. Our only
real response as this point is to offer our condolences?and aid to the people of
Ibadan, and insure that such an event never occurs again."

BOOK

Jacob's Shadow
by Andrew Hammond

Chapter 20

Samuel looked at him from across the table, but he might as well have been
peering at Jacob from the Devil's own palace in the deep blue sea.
After a moment Samuel rubbed his rheumy eyes. "You ever wonder about morals?" he
said. Jacob shook his head. "I do... all the damn time. I wonder what it means
to be good -- if there's some tally that says 'you only hurt ten people, so come
on up, but eleven and you're going straight to hell.' Then I think maybe it's a
little voice that tells you, way back in your head. And then I wonder what
happens when that voice goes away..."
Jacob reached under the table and put the little .22 pistol against one of
Samuel's kneecaps.
"I don't think you're going to like my answer to that. Where is she?"

Canal Road Tunnel Collapse
Hong Kong Standard

Explosions rocked the Wan Chai district two days ago as fighting between warring
Triads resulted in the cave-in and flooding of the Canal Road Tunnel,
effectively halting almost all access to and from the Wan Chai area. While the
fighting occurred in the early hours of the morning and traffic was light, a
number of bystanders were trapped during the fighting and subsequently presumed
dead. The names of the deceased have not been released at this time.
Police have barricaded the area at the Wan Chai terminal and forbidden any
access until a thorough forensic analysis can be made and the bodies removed. In
a statement released earlier today the police declined to name any suspects,
though Chief Joey Leung expressed that the "reprehensible nature of this crime
will not go unanswered by the Hong Kong police."

"Gray Death" Cases Misdiagnosed
Hong Kong Standard

Authorities confirmed today that a number of mysterious illnesses reported at
area clinics were not cases of "Gray Death" as had been previously feared, but
merely a seasonal outbreak of influenza.
Dr. Chang Lam of the People's Health Administration?headed the inquiry. "I can
say with complete certainty that these cases exhibit absolutely none of the
symptoms of the so-called 'Gray Death,' -- cases which, I might add, have so far
only been reported in the less well managed cities of America and Europe. Those
malcontents who have spread rumors to the contrary are merely feeding upon the
unjustified fears of the hardworking men and women of Hong Kong."
Dr. Lam went on to say that anyone observed making such claims should be
reported to local party leaders for counseling.

CONVERSATION: BARTENDER (ISAAC)

ISAAC
Beer is 15; wine is 120.

JC DENTON
Can I ask you something?

ISAAC
What do you want to know?

JC DENTON
Despite all I've read about the Triads, I wasn't prepared to see them operating
in the open, on the streets, and wearing uniforms. Doesn't the Chinese
government care?

ISAAC
The Chinese leave Hong Kong alone. They barricade the roads to control trade to
the mainland, but they know how business is done.

JC DENTON
I would think the secret smuggling operations of the Triads would disturb the
Chinese government.

ISAAC
Maybe the Luminous Path, but China knows that the Red Arrow are business owners,
entrepreneurs, community leaders, and that they protect the city from outside
influences.

JC DENTON
You said "outside influences." What does China fear?

ISAAC
China is the last sovereign country in the world. Authoritarian but willing --
unlike U.N.-governed countries -- to give its people the freedom to do what they
want.

JC DENTON
As long as they don't break the law.

ISAAC
Listen to me. This is real freedom, freedom to own property, make a profit, make
your life. The West, so afraid of strong government, now has no government. Only
financial power.

JC DENTON
Our governments have limited power by design.

ISAAC
Rhetoric... And you believe it! Don't you know where these slogans come from?

JC DENTON
I give up.

ISAAC
Well-paid researchers -- how do you say it? -- "think tanks," funded by big
businesses. What is that? A "think tank"?

JC DENTON
Hardly as sinister as a dictator, like China's Premier.

ISAAC
It's privately-funded propaganda. The Trilateral Commission in the United
States, for instance.

JC DENTON
The separation of powers acknowledges the petty ambitions of individuals; that's
its strength.

ISAAC
A system organized around the weakest qualities of individuals will produce
these same qualities in its leaders.

JC DENTON
Perhaps certain qualities are an inseparable part of human nature.

ISAAC
The mark of the educated man is the suppression of these qualities in favor of
better ones. The same is true of civilization.

JC DENTON

MAX CHEN
This is the headquarters of the Red Arrow Triad. You have come to the last place
in Hong Kong he would be seen.

JC DENTON
I don't understand.

MAX CHEN
I would cut out your tongue, but perhaps you are just ignorant. If you see Mr.
Tong, tell him that he and his Luminous Path associates must return the Dragon's
Tooth, or be driven from Hong Kong.

JC DENTON
What?

MAX CHEN
That is all.
This is the height or arrogance.
Ignorant gwailo!
Who does this American think he is?

2.  JC DENTON
    My name is J. C. Denton. I have something to tell you.

MAX CHEN
Then say it, and we will see what it is worth.

JC DENTON
Maggie Chow isn't who you think she is. She's an operative for a group called
Majestic 12. She stole the Dragon's Tooth and killed your predecessor.

MAX CHEN
You insult Ms. Chow -- to my face? What is your proof?

JC DENTON
I read it in a police file at the Wan Chai station.

MAX CHEN
The police? Don't be ridiculous -- they are mercenaries. The Luminous Path must
have paid them well for this!

JC DENTON
It makes sense! She's trying to provoke a war.

MAX CHEN
Don't raise your voice to me. If you want me to believe you, bring me some proof
-- bring me the sword itself. I'm not interested in anything else.
This is the height of arrogance.

Subject: Unpleasant Prospects

Max, we have been friends since we were children, so I hope you will not find
any disrespect in what I am about to say -- but first, I must express my great
sorrow at the death of Yuen. He was the first of many great Dragon Heads, and I
know you will follow the same emminent tradition. We here at police
headquarters?are doing our best to locate his killer, and I will be sure that
you have ample opportunity to discuss the matter with them once they have been
found.
But with all this said, it must also be said that the dispute between the Red
Arrow and the Luminous Path has become unseemly and not in the best interests of
the people of Hong Kong. The recent collapse of the Canal Road tunnel was
unfortunate and has resulted in many problems. I have been forced to authorize
the use of unpleasant measures if this continues.
Please contact me so that we may discuss this and resolve the situation before
it worsens.
Your Friend,

JC DENTON
I was -- before Paul showed up in New York. A day later I was helping the NSF.

GORDON QUICK
You want me to take your word? You are in Hong Kong now, and we are businessmen.
Paul earned our trust by working with us.

JC DENTON
I don't have time for games.

GORDON QUICK
No games. We would like another ally like Paul. The Triads are at war, thanks to
a woman named Maggie Chow. A sword was stolen from the Red Arrow Triad, and Miss
Chow started the war by blaming us, the Luminous Path.

1.  (JC DENTON
    I know who she is. She works for Majestic 12, and she did steal the sword. I
    read it in her file at the police station.

GORDON QUICK
That was you? You have guts, Mr. Denton. But it's not enough. No one trusts the
police. We need concrete proof. The sword.)

JC DENTON
Why is one sword so important?

GORDON QUICK
It is an extraordinary sword, called the "Dragon's Tooth." Nanotechnology
developed by the Red Arrow's former leader, before he was murdered. We know that
Chow is a liar, but we have no proof.

JC DENTON
I'll go speak to her. But first I need to find a man called Tracer Tong. I need
his help...

GORDON QUICK
Mr. Tong deals with businessmen, not beggars or strangers who might be spies.
Chow lives at 1313 Tonnochi Road. Be observant. Find and examine that sword. It
is the evidence we need.

JC DENTON
I'll help you against Ms. Chow, but then I'll need to see Tong, or I won't be
your ally for more than 12 hours.

GORDON QUICK
The former Red Arrow leader stole nanotech components from VersaLife; I believe
it was the corporation that had him murdered.
The Dragon's Tooth is the most perfect blade possible in a non-eutactic solid --
it would have given the Red Arrow an enormous advantage.
All contests between the Triads are decided with the ancient art of fighting.
The structure of the blade was maintained by a coating of nanoscale whetting
devices. Very sharp.
We have begun work on our own sword, but progress is slow.
I find it suspicious that Maggie Chow came to power precisely when the former
Red Arrow leader was murdered.
The sword has killed more men as an argument than it ever did as a weapon.
Keep your word. Go to Maggie Chow. Find out the truth.
(I will warn you once: do not assault our agents or representatives. The boy --
he was a good earner. If I didn't have explicit orders from Tong, I would kill
you right now.)

2.  JC DENTON
    She is the one responsible for the missing sword. She works for Majestic 12.

GORDON QUICK
Majestic 12?

JC DENTON
A group of conspirators who want to take control of Hong Kong.

GORDON QUICK
You have proof?

JC DENTON
Yes, I found the sword in her apartment.

GORDON QUICK
Good. Inform the Red Arrow dragon head. Then he will see who is the real
traitor.

JC DENTON
Where do I find this "dragon head"?

GORDON QUICK
Max Chen is his name. The Red Arrow headquarters is at the Lucky Money Club in
the mall area beneath the market. Come back and tell me what he says. We can
begin to negotiate a truce.
Let me know how Chen responds.

The main elevator. Maggie Chow will be angry if you arrive any other way.
This is a dead end. I advise you to turn back toward the market.
You are a tourist? Visit the Lucky Money while you're in Wan Chai.
I saw you speaking to that thug over there. Unwise.

2.  CONVERSATION: RED ARROW MEMBER

JC DENTON
Excuse me. Do you know a man named Tracer Tong?

RA MEMBER
That is a dangerous question to ask.

JC DENTON
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

Hong Kong is not a safe place for strangers. Take my advice -- do not get
involved.

Party Leader Xan,
I was much inspired by your speech to our local community resource center and
wish to do my part in helping to maintain a free China: as you have said, there
are many threats to that freedom both from within and without.
It is with glad heart, then, that I am able to inform you of suspicious
activities of Dr. Tracey Feng. Dr. Feng has declared on a number of occasions
that he believes cases of "Gray Death" are going untreated (a situation I cannot
believe the Party would permit), and has often been observed leaving at odd
hours on what he declares to be "family emergencies." I believe that Dr. Feng is
a good individual, with the best hopes for Hong Kong and China at heart, and
could thus benefit from counseling.
Ms. Chow was kind enough to bring this to my attention, and should be saluted
for the many hours of entertainment and happiness she has brought to the Chinese
people.

JC DENTON
She should never have sent me to the police station. Now I know she is hiding

MAY SUNG
Mother Chow -- Mr. JC Denton.

MAGGIE CHOW
(Mr. J. C. Denton...) in the flesh. As dark and serious as his brother.

JC DENTON
You know who I am... and Paul? You know my brother?

MAGGIE CHOW
Intimately. Call me Maggie.

1.  JC DENTON
    Paul never mentioned you.

MAGGIE CHOW
That is why he is still alive: he can keep a secret, even from his own brother.

JC DENTON
But why --

2.  JC DENTON
    Can you help me find a man named Tracer Tong?

MAGGIE CHOW
Of course. Mr. Tong, your brother's most trusted ally. He insisted I not reveal
his location until we are sure we can trust you. He has much to fear from
Majestic 12.

JC DENTON
I don't understand.

MAGGIE CHOW
Paul told you about Majestic 12, correct? The conspiracy behind UNATCO?

JC DENTON
...just the name...

MAGGIE CHOW
Majestic 12 sent Paul to murder the former Red Arrow leader -- and me, too.

JC DENTON
And he double-crossed them?

MAGGIE CHOW
Let's just say I persuaded him to join our side.

JC DENTON
What does Majestic 12 want with the Red Arrow?

MAGGIE CHOW
We are winning the Triad war against Majestic 12's ally -- the Luminous Path. We
were developing a new technology. You might have heard about a sword?

1.  JC DENTON
    The Dragon's Tooth, right?

2.  JC DENTON
    What kind of sword?

MAGGIE CHOW
A nanotech blade.

MAGGIE CHOW
The Triads settle disputes in contests of skill, which includes the crafting of
weapons. The Dragon's Tooth would have made us unstoppable.

JC DENTON
So Majestic 12... they're trying to tip the balance? Give the Luminous Path a
technological advantage?

MAGGIE CHOW
Exactly. I try to warn the people of the danger, and the Luminous Path calls me
a liar. The police have all the evidence they need to settle this, locked up in
the station at the Wan Chai market, but they will not act. Go and see. I know
the code to their vault: 87342.

1.  JC DENTON
    It's only fair to tell you that I spoke with Gordon Quick before coming here. I
    though he was a friend of my brother's. I agreed to visit you and learn the
    truth of the situation.

2.  JC DENTON
    Who are the Luminous Path, anyway?

MAGGIE CHOW
The less successful of the Triads. Their compound at the Wan Chai Market is for
petty thieves and drug-dealers.

JC DENTON
The market? I came from there just now; I must have missed the place.

MAGGIE CHOW
Yes, you were seen. The new Red Arrow leader is Max Chen, and you don't have to
go to the Lucky Money for him to know your activities. Now tell me about Paul.
Why did he not return?

1.  JC DENTON
    There's something I have to tell you about Paul.
    MAGGIE CHOW
    Majestic 12 is arming the Luminous Path with the Dragon Tooth's sword. We must
    find a way to end the war immediately.

JC DENTON
Miss Chow... Maggie... Paul is dead.

MAGGIE CHOW
What?

JC DENTON
UNATCO agents killed him. I'm sorry. I understand how you must feel.

MAGGIE CHOW
I... No, it can't be.

JC DENTON
You all right?

MAGGIE CHOW
He was a brave man... honest -- too, too honest.

JC DENTON
Yes, he was.

MAGGIE CHOW
You try to prepare yourself, but...

JC DENTON
I know, the danger.

MAGGIE CHOW
I need to be alone. Please...
He was the only brave enough to stand up to them.
I will have my revenge. Trust me.
The police are corrupt and incompetent. We will have to help ourselves.
Please... go now.
Let May Sung show you out.
It’s time for you to go.
I said get out.

2.  JC DENTON
    Paul's on his way to Hong Kong. I don't know when he will arrive.

MAGGIE CHOW
Then you must think for yourself. In Hong Kong the truth is seldom kept in plain
sight.
From up here, the city is scenery, a mountain that never changes, but everywhere
the sands are shifting. We cannot know who to trust -- the police, even our own
families.

JC DENTON
I can look around... try to learn something about the Luminous Path.

MAGGIE CHOW
All the necessary evidence is at the police station in Wan Chai market. If only
the police would act...
The Luminous Path are easy prey. All Majestic 12 must do is wave some money
under their noses.
We must expose the conspiracy behind the Luminous Path, then they will fall
apart from the inside.
When your brother arrives, please tell him I have an important matter to
discuss.
Go to the police station; you will find the information we need.
Enough talk. We must act.
The police are corrupt and incompetent. We will have to help ourselves.
Let May Sung show you out.
It’s time for you to go.
I said get out.

CONVERSATION: MAY SUNG

MAY SUNG
I will accompany you.
The floor coverings were made by hand in Tibet.
Take a look around.

Get away from there.
Don't make me call the police.

Let me accompany you to the door.

BOOK

The True Way
by Kishiro Yoshitaka

...If one is to imagine the "perfect sword" that can cut and swing with no
resistance, a sword that is an extension of the mind and heart of the warrior
who wields it and not a dead weight of steel, then it becomes clear that the
sword is of little consequence compared to the will of the strategist. Those who
would master the Way must come to understand this: a sword is a tool whose
purpose is to cut. Each day the strategist must practice this until it is not
practice, but a part of their spirit. The strategist knows that every sword they
wield is perfect, for their will is perfect, and it is through their will alone
that they win battles...

BOOK

Tai-Fun
by Lin Yeoh

...The history of the Triads is in many ways the history of modern China.
Popular myth holds that the Triads originated as a resistance movement against
the Ching dynasty after it descended from Manchuria to seize the capital of
Peking by force. When faced with a rebellion in the Fukien province, the Ching
dynasty recruited an order of warrior monks who were later deemed expendable by
the Emperor and all but exterminated. Survivors organized a number of secret
monasteries and became known as the "Hung Mun," dedicated to overthrowing the
Chings.
The Hung Mun showed a remarkable political adaptability, portraying themselves
as protectors of the people even as they accepted money from Japanese corporate
fronts during WWII...

BOOK

Insurgent
by X

...When faced with the subversion of an organized ruling body, external action -

- even when executed in concert, as a group -- is often ineffectual. True
  revolution can only come from working within, and in this the ultimate change
  that can be brought about by an individual is magnified by the very machinery
  that such organizations utilize to maintain their own authority. Historically,
  ruling bodies are always outnumbered by those they rule -- but still they manage
  to maintain a disproportionate amount of power through a combination of
  tradition, confusion, and punishment. An operative who learns to simulate the
  veneer of a loyalist and guard their own secret heart can utilize those very
  same tools to overthrow such organizations, or shift them to a more
  ideologically pleasing axis...

FROM: WAN CHAI DISTRICT, POST 11384
TO: CENTRAL POLICE COMMAND, H.K.

Attached you will find a full surveillance report for the activities of subject
MAGGIE CHOW (HKS0084393). Ms. Chow's associations with the RED ARROW TRIAD and
its Dragon Head, MAX CHEN, are a matter of record; however, recent evidence
indicated that she may also have been involved with the death of Chen's
predecessor, YUEN KONG (HKS0134091), a contributing factor to the current gang
war. Ms. Chow and her relationship to the VERSALIFE CORPORATION are also under
investigation, but show a high probability of being linked to the recent
conflict between the Triads.
District officers are respectfully asked to note that there are several tactical
options for accessing Ms. Chow's penthouse: a service entrance at the rear of
the address; a renovation project in progress on the building's seventh floor;
and the roof. These options are outlined more fully in the surveillance report
if it becomes necessary to detain Ms. Chow or search her premises.

20% more quickly than expected. Some nasty noises earlier, several of the

UNATCO Responds to Terrorist Attack
New World Press - New York City

A terrorist strike on Liberty Island was blunted this past week when UNATCO
forces moved swiftly to neutralize the threat. The attack, the result of a
poorly organized attempt to break security at UNATCO Headquarters by the
National Secessionist Forces (NSF), was characterized by one unidentified source
as a "futile gesture." Walton Simons, Director of FEMA, worked closely with
UNATCO to coordinate both US and UNATCO forces in a joint operation to root out
the remaining elements of the terrorist network in New York.
"Terrorism is very much a snake that slithers out of the tall grass," said
Simons. "It is our responsibility?to always remain alert to the danger it
presents, and to act decisively when it appears."
Authorities are currently attempting to locate JC Denton, one of the terrorist
leaders who escaped in the aftermath of the attack.

CONVERSATION: THUG

THUG
I'm not your type.

JC DENTON
I just want to ask a few questions.

THUG
Look, I was here first. Chen told me himself: if there's a job, I get it.

JC DENTON
What kind of job?

THUG
Just back off. I got fired at the Quick Stop next door -- without even a warning
-- and I need the cash.

JC DENTON
Tough luck.

THUG
Yeah, well, but I'm gonna get them back. I know the login to their computer.
It's MANAGEMENT, password CODE324. One of these nights, I'm gonna sneak in there
and trash all their records.

JC DENTON
What's a Quick Stop cashier doing working for the Red Arrow?

THUG
I ain't working yet.
Hey, man, you're blocking the view.
I like goth chicks.
You're getting on my nerves.

CONVERSATION: STUFFY SUIT (MR. SING)

SING
Good evening.

(JC DENTON
Sorry to bother you...

JC DENTON
Hello there.
Do you know a man named Max Chen?

SING
Of course I know Max! A terrific fellow!

JC DENTON
Do you know where I can find him?

SING
In the back room! He runs the whole Red Arrow from here! Hey, you're not with
the police, are you?

JC DENTON
I'll tell you later.
Great place here!

SING
Isn't it? People have the wrong idea about the Triads, you know.

JC DENTON
In what way?

SING
They run the economy! The black-market prices in clubs like this let people have
a good time.
Good evening.
You must be American.
...always find satisfaction at the Lucky Money.
My personal evaluation: the Filipino girls of the Red Arrow are simply the best.
Many of my clients are from the Red Arrow.
I've always enjoyed doing business with the Triads.

CAROLE

CONVERSATION: BUSINESSWOMAN & VERSALIFE EMPLOYEE

BUSINESSWOMAN
I've never seen so many troopers. They must be close to a breakthrough.

EMPLOYEE
But which division?

BUSINESSWOMAN
Maybe all of them. Something fundamental. I saw guards in Biotech, too.

EMPLOYEE
I think it's just the UC.

BUSINESSWOMAN
They've had that for weeks.

EMPLOYEE
But word has gotten out. Every engineer on the planet --

BUSINESSWOMAN
VersaLife already has the best security in the industry.

EMPLOYEE
Even my game-programmer friend in Texas offered me a million credits for one
hour on the UC. Wanted to make the Game of Life with buckyballs... Joking, of
course.

BUSINESSWOMAN
I don't like being in the dark.

EMPLOYEE
What do you mean?

BUSINESSWOMAN
Everything so compartmentalized...

EMPLOYEE
A pain, I know. But all it takes is one leak to the Net, and there goes our work
into the public domain.

BUSINESSWOMAN
It's more like the way you'd organize a prison camp than a laboratory.

EMPLOYEE
Let's not get melodramatic.

BUSINESSWOMAN
I've spent months making this rotor for sorting calcium ions -- and I don't even
know what it's FOR.

EMPLOYEE
Kaczynski was right about the division of labor -- I'll give him that much. Want
another drink?

BUSINESSWOMAN
Who puts the pieces together?

EMPLOYEE
Someone who makes a lot more money than we do.

BUSINESSWOMAN
I think management is involved in something criminal.

EMPLOYEE
I... don't know if you should be saying that.

BUSINESSWOMAN
Really. Why the codes? All the procedures? Why'd the data-entry people disappear
today? What did the company have them doing?

EMPLOYEE
That's outside your department.

BUSINESSWOMAN
I want to know. What do they do all day -- and all night -- down on Level 2?

EMPLOYEE

MAX CHEN

The sword was never destroyed. It was stolen, and she is the one who stole it.

MAX CHEN
Preposterous!

JC DENTON
I have it right here.

MAX CHEN
But... Miss Chow?

JC DENTON
She works for a group called Majestic 12. She's using you and the Red Arrow for
her own ends.

MAX CHEN
No, you must be mistaken.

JC DENTON
Think about it. She murders your predecessor, hides the sword, pushes the Red
Arrow into a war with the Luminous Path, and then...? What next? The Triads are
weakened, and an outside group seizes power. Sound far-fetched?

MAX CHEN
There must be an explanation.

JC DENTON
Perhaps you should meet with the leaders of the Luminous Path.

MAX CHEN
Hmmm. Perhaps. For now, take them this message: I will stop hostilities until I
have completed an investigation.

CHEN'S BODYGUARD
Boss.

MAX CHEN
What is it?

CHEN'S BODYGUARD
Marty at the door says we have trouble. Soldiers coming in -- she says they are
some kind of mechs.

JC DENTON
MJ12 troops. They must have followed me.

MAX CHEN
You led them here. You should have been more careful.

CHEN'S BODYGUARD
State your business and go.
You're acting like a fool.
Time for you to go.

MAX CHEN
You must escape and reach Gordon Quick.
They should have never attacked us here...

RED ARROW MEMBER
It's a military unit!
These troops -- they are not human.

LOUIS PAN
I will do a good job.

CONVERSATION: GORDON QUICK

1.  JC DENTON
    You were right. Maggie Chow is a con artist.

GORDON QUICK
You have proof?

JC DENTON
Yes, I found the sword in her apartment.

GORDON QUICK
Good. Inform the Red Arrow dragon head. Then he will see who is the real
traitor.

JC DENTON
I've already been to the Lucky Money. Max Chen has declared a truce between the
Red Arrow and the Luminous Path.

2.  JC DENTON
    I informed Chen about the sword. He's declared a truce between the Red Arrow and
    the Luminous Path.

GORDON QUICK
A truce? Are you certain?

JC DENTON
Majestic 12 attacked the club. I think he would consider forming an alliance.

GORDON QUICK
Mr. Denton, you are the man I hoped you were. Tracer Tong is inside, in his
laboratory below the compound. The door is in our sparring room. He will know
what to do next. To enter our compound, use the code 1997.
I look forward to shaking the hand of my enemy.
I worry that the Red Arrow will try to reassemble the sword before peace can be
made.
You must use the secret passage in the sparring room to get to Tong's

Do not linger in the compound.
You will be permitted to go about your business.

LP MEMBER 3
Do not interrupt us with questions.
We will check with the dragon head about whether you can come in here.
Are you expecting a tour?

Journal of Hung Kwan Gordon Quick

...is it the steel in her heart, much like that of her father, that leads me to
love her; how unfortunate that the Old Gods should laugh and she should be the
child of their Dragon Head -- the man who would lead the Red Arrow against the
Luminous Path and destroy all we have sought to create for the Celestial
Kingdom. But I know that whatever fate has decreed for us, we will walk that
road together. There can be no betrayal in the feelings we have for each other,
and no teachings that can show me the error in our actions.
Today, Master Tong has informed me that we will have visitors...

So your friend stole a black helicopter. Very courageous.

CONVERSATION: TRACER TONG

1.  JC DENTON
    Mr. Tong. You knew my brother, Paul Denton.

2.  JC DENTON
    Mr. Tong. You know my brother, Paul Denton.

TONG
Yes. A reliable man. So your killswitch has been activated.

JC DENTON
I feel fine, but it's been over 16 hours.

TONG
See how easily our technologies turn on us? The more power you think you have,
the more quickly it slips from your hands.

JC DENTON
Can you do something about it?

TONG
That will depend. You, like your brother, are an extraordinary piece of
technology. I never pass up the chance to try a new blade, but I fear that at
the crucial moment I may lift up my arm to strike and you will twist free of my
grasp.

JC DENTON
In other words, I'll owe you a favor.

TONG
Indeed. As will your friend, Mr. Jacobson, a man of much useful knowledge. He
arrived in Hong Kong shortly after you did. I was forced to keep him in custody
until I could verify his identity and his loyalties.

JC DENTON
I assume he checked out.

TONG
I believe he is sincere. Now -- go down the stairs to the operating platform and
I will examine your systems.
Just step inside the chamber.
Stay right there.
Success. Come back to the control room.

JC DENTON
That's it?

TONG
A simple "switch," as they call it.

1.  JC DENTON
    Have you heard about Paul?

TONG
Your friend informed me. A courageous man, your brother.

JC DENTON
I plan to make sure he didn't die for nothing.

TONG
We will try. Unfortunately, nothing is certain in politics.

2.  JC DENTON
    Have you heard from Paul?

TONG
On his way, according to Smuggler in New York. He will be fine. Meanwhile, we
still face the likelihood of a Triad war here in Hong Kong.

JC DENTON
Quick and Chen declared a truce just a few minutes ago.

TONG
A good bit of diplomacy, I admit, but it won't hold. Not with the sword left to
be fought over.

JC DENTON
I think they will be slow to anger with Maggie Chow out of the picture.

TONG
No. In their system, the sword is a doomsday weapon, a temptation... We must
recover the ROM-encoding from VersaLife and make it available to BOTH Triads.

JC DENTON
So that's all you expect me in the way of a favor? A little corporate espionage?

TONG
The first of many favors. Remember -- I saved your life. Now pay attention. The
VersaLife elevator north of the market will require an employee number; try 06288. Once inside, find Mr. Hundley, the shift supervisor. He can be persuaded
to give you access to the labs.

JC DENTON
Hundley...

TONG
You will find him receptive. He is the corrupt official who sold the Red Arrow
the technology to begin with.

JC DENTON
I'll find the ROM-encoding, but I'm not your henchman. I'll help you as long as
we have a mutual interest.

TONG
If you choose to fight Majestic 12, you will need an ally. We will have a
"mutual interest" for some time. In fact, I took the liberty of setting up a
computer account for you. Login: JCDenton, password: sanctuary. Feel free to use
the machine in my office.
We have much to offer one another if we cooperate.
I will always remember your brother, a true martyr. (I need Paul. I wish he
would hurry up.)
Your friend from UNATCO is very knowledgeable about certain networks. He will be
very useful.
I've wanted to learn more about VersaLife for a long time.
As you know, VersaLife manufactures Ambrosia.
More when you return. Go now.

Project Dibbuk: Thoughts and Meditations
Written by the Honored Ang-Yun Li

...as the Most Dignified of the Celestial Kingdom had expected, inquiries into
the nature of MJ12 and the so-called "Project Dibbuk" were quickly declined in
an extremely abrupt manner (and resulted in the unfortunate but necessary loss
of one humble servant who will be forever exalted in the annals of our
organization); however, further perseverance has suggested that the
aforementioned project involved the quiet acquisition of Chinese technology that
was later applied to the invention of an improved "stealth helicopter" for use
in covert MJ12 operations. A careful examination of electronic traces would lean
an astute observer to conclude that this information was liberated during a
number of skilled intrusions into Chinese corporate data wells originating from
UNATCO headquarters in New York, which in turn leads to certain questions about
links between UNATCO and MJ12...

BOOK

MJ12 Nano-Augmentation Experiment Series 3-C
For Internal Use Only

...recent human trials and subsequent mortality studies have demonstrated that
nano-augmenting of baseline human physiology is not without hazards: notably,
key anatomical regions can support only limited augmentation without risking
rejection or accelerated degeneration. Research is ongoing, but current data
suggests the following nano-augmentation combinations have acceptable risk:
Arms: Combat Strength or Microfibral Muscle
Legs: Speed Enhancement or Run Silent
Subdermal (1): EMP Shield or Ballistic Protection
Subdermal (2): Cloak or Radar Transparency
Torso (1): Aqualung or Environmental Resistance
Torso (2): Regeneration or Energy Resistance
Torso (3): Synthetic Heart or Power Recirculator
Cranium: Aggressive Defense System or Spy Drone
Optics: Targeting or Vision Enhancement
In Series 3-D we will examine the viability of genetically suppressing the
immune response through epsilon elimination...

Well, I've got your account all set up and you should be ready to go --

I've been talking a lot to Tracer and he's really an amazing person. I think I
can learn a lot from him. I know you might find this odd, but all the time I
worked for UNATCO seems like a dream, killing time in some virtual world so I

Subject: Required Objectives

There is little time. You should know that the organization for which you have
worked, whose goals and interests you believed to be your own, is not what it
seems. UNATCO is merely an arm of a larger entity known as Majestic 12. Majestic
12 seeks to use force and intimidation to seize absolute control. Of everything.
They will not hesitate to use all means necessary to achieve this goal, and have
engineered the disease you refer to as the "Gray Death" in an effort to
accomplish this.
They must not be allowed to succeed. Your brother has been an aid to me in this
matter but cannot help me any longer. You must take his place. The Gray Death is
a nanotechnologically engineered virus. You are immune, but others are not. You
must locate the Universal Constructor used to create the Gray Death and destroy
it. My information indicates that it is in Hong Kong, housed in a Majestic 12
facility beneath the corporation known as VersaLife.
You must not fail.

They'd fire me on the spot if they knew I was sending you this message, but I've
got a feeling they'll be drumming me out any day now as is. Alex tells me
there's no way this communication can be traced, so I trust he knows what the
hell he's doing.
I understand why you did it. Being a soldier isn't just following orders, it's
following those orders in the service of a higher cause. When that cause is
betrayed, we're not soldiers anymore -- just pieces on a chess board dying for
the wrong reasons.
Things've been bad since you left. Manderley has disappeared; they say he's been
relieved of duty. The Director of FEMA, Walton Simons, has assumed interim
authority, but there's something about him I don't like. He seems reasonable,
but there's something behind his eyes. I saw the same look on men in combat when
all the part of them that was human just left.
I have some friends who used to be associated with UNATCO -- they've
disappeared, but I may see if I can find them again. Maybe they'll be useful to
you. We'll see. In the meanwhile, do what you think is right, J.C., and let the
Devil take the rest.

CONVERSATION: ALEX JACOBSON

JC DENTON
You took a big risk following me here. Thanks.

ALEX
When you believe in something, you've just got to do it.

JC DENTON
How'd you find Tong so quickly?

ALEX
Turns out I knew him all along: TT//UnderNet. 0924.243.886. I posted a message
to the board, and he contacted me himself.

JC DENTON
Any news from Jaime?

ALEX
No sign of him yet. I hope he made it.

JC DENTON
Yeah, me too.
Did you ever dig up anything about this "Daedalus" character? I'm still hearing
from him.

ALEX
Actually, I did... sort of. Crypto says Daedalus was supposedly a government AI
project, also known as Echelon IV.

JC DENTON
"Supposedly"?

ALEX
I'm getting this from anonymous crypto boards. Daedalus was supposed to beat the
old content-recognition?problem in surveillance; it was a program that could
search all the terabytes of intercepted messages for subversive?content.

JC DENTON
So what happened?

ALEX
Never panned out, as far as I know. The problem was just too hard. They blew
through a lot of taxpayer money but finally had to scrap the whole project.

JC DENTON
So the thing that's talking in my head is... what? A resurrected AI?

ALEX
I wish I knew.
Take the security at VersaLife seriously; they're very protective of their
research programs.
VersaLife is one of the few companies that funds basic research in several
branches of science.
The corporation doesn't share data with the medical community. That's why they
do so well.
They could make a killing if they released Ambrosia publicly.
Jaime should be in the city by now.
Tong has connections. You should scope out the labs for upgrades.
I'll be here to back you up, just like at UNATCO.

I'd like to have your employee evaluations by COB today, with special attention
paid to those who've been engaging in non-contributory behavior or who've spread
information counter to the ideological well-being of the company. We'll shortly
be rotating you out of the "receptionist" position here and posting you to

Subject: Weekly Memo

I've recently heard some negative discussion in the halls of VersaLife that I'd
like to address: we here at VersaLife are doing a difficult job, the kind of job
that few people ever have the opportunity to pursue -- because here at VersaLife
we're changing the world. A job such as this demands the commitment and
dedication of those few, special individuals with the talent and determination
to actually make that happen. A family. Your family. By working together, there
is nothing we can't achieve, but if we back off the throttle now it could result
in a loss of momentum that would be disastrous.
This is a war. A war against disease and poverty, and if we're not willing to
reach out and support our neighbor in the cubicle across from us, to get in that
foxhole with them and jump on that grenade, to make the sacrifices necessary to
create truly revolutionary products, then we've already lost.
Negative attitudes will only poison the work environment of all those around
you, but by trusting in the VersaLife family you can be sure that your best
efforts will be rewarded. We're already making changes, exciting changes, and I
hope to tell you about them in future memos.

JC DENTON
They probably don't want you telling people that.

JOHN SMITH
So? I don't care. I figured it out today, how they do it. People with my job get
the Gray Death. In a couple of weeks I could be in a camp. I could already be
sick.

JC DENTON
Why would they do that?

JOHN SMITH
Whatever's in those labs. Stuff goes in there, instruments, military
personnel... none of it goes on the record. Iverson had this job, that's why he
got sick. Chang... Kiley... Watts... Now it's me.

1.  JC DENTON
    I got access to the labs from the shift supervisor. I'll check them out and let
    you know what I find.

JOHN SMITH
Yeah? Hundley? He's the guy who keeps me here.

JC DENTON
Guy in a suit? He's dead. You don't have to worry about him anymore.

JOHN SMITH
Really? You really killed him? That's the guy they had watching me.

JC DENTON
Part of an intelligence operation.

2.  JC DENTON

JC DENTON
Does it matter?

JOHN SMITH
If I get you down there, can you do something for me?

JOHN SMITH
Well, okay. Sure, it doesn't matter to me. The code to the elevator's 6512. I'll
make sure you have access once you get to the lab.
It's a big operation down there.
Lots of genetics work going on. That's all I've been able to figure out.
I'll make a break for it after my shift.
I can't leave now because of the cameras.
I hope they don't figure out it was us.

I think something bad is happening downstairs, but I don't know what. Yesterday
I found a man in the bathroom, dressed in street clothes and raving about... I
don't know what. Doctors and the things they did to him. Downstairs, he said,
but there is no downstairs. I don't know how he got into the building. When I
called security a bunch of scary guys in riot armor showed up -- they didn't say
anything, just shot him with a dart. He stopped talking. Maybe he was dead. When
I tried to get closer they shoved me half-way across the room, like swatting an
insect.
My supervisor came. Questioned me about "loyalty" and "shared objectives with
the program." Mentioned how dangerous Hong Kong streets were, that security was
for my protection, and that it was there to prevent unfortunate incidents.
There are more of the guys in scary riot armor. They are coming this way. I

older and more dangerous foe called simply "Leviathan."
"It's an action-adventure-philosophy film," said Todd. "And hopefully you'll see
things -- experience?things -- you've never had an opportunity?to experience
before. With this movie I'm really hoping to build an intricate, engrossing
tapestry of story and character -- before everything goes horribly awry, of

I've just finished supervising the refit of the superfreighter fuel tanks to

but I know you'll want to rapidly offload it once it reaches New York. The
biocontamination seals will _not_ last past 36 hours, however, and a complete
Level 4 sterilization of the tanks will need to occur once the virus is
offloaded to insure that there's no incidental release. I integrated some sealed

The Series P trials have so far produced excellent results, and I continue to

augmentation -- at a fraction of the cost and effort. The Series P agents show a
marked lack of pain response with a corresponding increase in endurance and
strength, while psychological conditioning has resulted in a Loyalty Estimate of
9.66 on the Yitzhak Scale.
The modified explosive self-termination switch added in Series N has also proven
highly effective in eliminating all traces of the Series P in the event that
they are mortally wounded or otherwise unable to complete their mission
objectives.
We're continuing in our attempts to isolate the source of the albino traits, but
so far the simple addition of sunglasses and dark clothing appear to have
resolved the problem in a practical fashion.

You were asking for the specs of our new commando units this morning, so I've
attached the relevant files. The short version is that most of the improvement
in combat effectiveness comes from enhancements to their power armor developed
here and in our labs in Zurich.
The new armor (we've nicknamed it "Obsidian") has greatly expanded possibilities
as a light weapons platform, while a layer of microcore foam insulation
disperses heat from flame and plasma attacks. It's obviously invulnerable to any
kind of gas or toxicological attack, as well. Makes it perfect for riot control
and NBS battlefields. Beauty of it is the whole thing's powered by standard

Better than we expected. The array of reaction modules has allowed the UC to

BOB PAGE
Wonderful. We'll have to try that trick at Area 51.

MAGGIE CHOW
The problem, you understand, is primarily a security concern.

BOB PAGE
Never mind that punk from UNATCO. The security here is adequate, and we have a
long-term program guaranteed to make him irrelevant. We call it Icarus.

Let us be quiet. Agent Denton from America has retrieved the software component.
Please accept our gratitude.

JC DENTON
It is my honor.

GORDON QUICK
Begin.

MAX CHEN
As the faces of a perfect blade are reflections of one another, as they join
together to make a perfect edge...
...so we shall form one blade, not the male and female swords of Gangjiang, one
which must avenge the other, but one weapon, precise in its purpose though
wielded by many arms.

GORDON QUICK
And much as this steel sharpens its edge and anneals its own surfaces, let us
preserve -- together -- the form of our traditions.

MAX CHEN
...the only enduring work of man, that which is born again with the next
generation.

GORDON QUICK
Forever!

MAX CHEN
Forever!

GORDON QUICK
Again, accept our thanks, Mr. Denton. You will have to join us for drinks at the
Lucky Money later tonight. In the meantime, Mr. Tong wants to see you.

JC DENTON
Thanks for the offer. Maybe I'll stop by.

MAX CHEN
Come join us for drinks at the Lucky Money. We must celebrate!
At last -- we are one Triad.
You have rendered us a most valuable service.

GORDON QUICK
Tracer Tong will want to congratulate you.
The peace will be profitable for both sides.
Tracer Tong will want to congratulate you.

All right! Get out! Enough games in the temple!
The grandfathers of the Triads all had Uzis. Tradition... Bah!

GORDON QUICK
The Luminous Path can ship penguins to Norway -- and document that they came

MAX CHEN
Your operations must have been difficult without official protection.

GORDON QUICK
A minor inconvenience. Not as difficult as you must have found running a

MAX CHEN
Not even noticeable. The Red Arrow makes many big deals.

GORDON QUICK
I will show you what big is. Fifty tons per month! With no help from the big

CONVERSATION: TRACER TONG

JC DENTON
Peace between the Triads is now official.

TONG
Good. We begin to operate from a position of strength. We will start
manufacturing the swords and distributing them to our allies.

JC DENTON
What next? VersaLife was crawling with troops. I think they were hiding more
than sword technology down there.

TONG
Tell me about the labs. Paul and I concluded that VersaLife does the
manufacturing, while the real research takes place in North America.

JC DENTON
Plenty of scientists -- biotech, physics, nanotech -- several research
divisions. It would seem we still have a mutual interest.

TONG
We know they manufacture Ambrosia. If you went back -- and gained access to the
Level 2 labs -- perhaps you would find something on the Gray Death. Your
brother's failure in New York has left me with nothing.

JC DENTON
Do you think you could find a cure?

TONG
That cannot be determined until I have a schematic of the virus particle and the
molecular structure of Ambrosia.

JC DENTON
I'll go back, but won't they be ready for me?

TONG
There's a back way, at the north end of the Canal Road Tunnel, which is just
east of the temple. I sent an agent in that way once. She turned up a keycode to
the nanotech research wing: 55655 -- but no data.

JC DENTON
Worth a try.

TONG
By the way -- VersaLife lost one of their R & D men in the Canal Road Tunnel
collapse -- a guy we think was carrying nanotech assets. He did some of the
basic research that went into your implants. You might take a look, if you don't
mind going for a dive.

JC DENTON
Maybe I'll check it out.

TONG
Perhaps you can locate and destroy the manufacturing facilities as well.
I will monitor your progress from here.

CONVERSATION: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX
I've been checking out the schematics you found. That's one hell of a sword.
It's a generally accepted tenet of nanotechnology that nanites and traditional
metals don't mix, but VersaLife found a way. It all seems completely obvious to
me now.
They actually embed iron rods in the carbon framework of the nanites --
electromagnets which allow microscopic scanners, cleaners, and hammers to move
over the surface of the blade.
Tong's very pleased. He plans to mass-produce the Dragon's Tooth and arm the
Triads.
I'd like to know what else VersaLife has going on down there.
Tong's keeping me busy. He wants me to verify that the Dragon's Tooth won't set
off the acoustic sensors the city government installed to detect gunfire.
We found a useful ally in Tong. I just hope he can be trusted.
I'll be right here if you need me.

Seems to be some inventory data there; VersaLife has been synthesizing the Gray
Death Virus in great quantities. The entire stockpile has been loaded onto a
superfreighter going to New York. Interesting... the previous owner of the ship
was Stanton Dowd. Ever heard of the Illuminati? Come back to the compound. I
have much to tell you.
...tracking down this Dowd connection. Illuminati fingerprints all over the
sterics -- I'm talking about the molecule's shape: 17 segments, 23 coupling
points... Only Illuminati technicians use sleeve bearings with 34-fold and 46-
fold symmetry; multiples of 17 and 23. 1723. The birth of Adam Weishaupt. Not a

No joke, Mr. Denton. They're quite real, though not as powerful as they were at
the beginning of the century. I know a few of the former leaders.

JC DENTON
Like Stanton Dowd?

TONG
Yes. Plus Beth DuClare, Morgan Everett... most of them in Paris, I understand.

JC DENTON
What do they have to do with Majestic 12?

TONG
A question for Dowd. I will contact him in New York. Hopefully he will agree to
meet you.

JC DENTON
What about a hacker named "Daedalus?"

TONG
A valuable informant -- he sent me one of the codes I needed to find that
superfreighter.

JC DENTON
A superfreighter. That's enough virus to infect a continent.

TONG
Your pilot is landing in the courtyard. Find Dowd and see if he knows where the
ship is going or how we can stop it. In any case it is time you left Hong Kong;
there is word of a UNATCO agent searching for you here. A German, they say.
Augmented.

JC DENTON
Tell your people not to tangle with him. I'll deal with him myself.
Do you have what you need to synthesize a cure?

TONG
The data you recovered should provide an answer... in time.

JC DENTON
I also destroyed the Universal Constructor they were using to manufacture the
virus.

TONG
A Universal Constructor... I should have known.

JC DENTON
...but I did it on the advice of the hacker, Daedalus. Who is he, really? Alex
says he may be an AI, part of an old government program.

TONG
An AI... The thought occurred to me, but more likely it is cover for a real
human being.

JC DENTON
But who?

TONG
A powerful man, we must assume. I don't like mysteries, but at least he appears
to be on our side.

JC DENTON
I don't like mysteries either.

TONG
Your friend Jock is waiting in the courtyard.
Daedalus... That sounds very familiar.
I wish your brother was here; he would see that he was wrong about you.
My guess is that Majestic 12 is a faction of the Illuminati which did away with
its parent.
All I know is that something terrified Dowd and Everett.
Once two of the most powerful people on earth, now the old Illuminati heads are
afraid even to be seen in public.
Be careful in New York. They'll be waiting for you.

I slipped out right after your escape. Security was a shambles, so I brought you
a little something from the supply closet.

JC DENTON
You didn't have to take that kind of risk.

JAIME REYES
It was worth it -- trust me. They gave me a funny look in customs, but I managed
to bring over an augmentation upgrade canister.

Isn't that "sensitive technology?"

Take the upgrade. I'm just glad I can help.

Well, thanks. Now hang tight for a while. UNATCO will be looking for you.

Jaime had a close call getting out of UNATCO, but I'm sure glad he made a break
for it. I think he'll have a longer lifespan helping Tong out at the operating
theater.
Quite a lot of data you brought in. A lot to study.
Don't know how Tong expects to find a cure. It's not even a real virus.
Kind of a hybrid of viral proteins and nanomechanical machine parts.
A long body like a dragon fly. Sockets built into the shaft, saucer-shaped
modules plugged in here and there.
A general-purpose device of some kind, very customizable.
Infection would be a ludicrously simple task for such a complicated machine.
Ambrosia turns out to be one of the saucer-shaped modules, a hardware-lock of
some kind.
We could replicate the Ambrosia functionality, but to actually destroy the nano-
virus... I don't know.
You go after that shipment. I'll help Tong.

Food of the Gods?

NEW YORK -- Ambrosia, the mythical food of the gods, may in fact be something
more than a myth -- it may be a cure for the mysterious "Gray Death" that has
infected this city with sickening dread over the past several months.
What is this Ambrosia, and where does it come from? Speaking on the condition of
anonymity, highly placed sources have revealed in an exclusive to the "Midnight
Sun" that Ambrosia is the government codename for a cure to the plague that has
already taken so many lives. Unfortunately, the current manufacturing process
appears to yield only small amounts of Ambrosia which have so far been
prioritized for ranking government officials and a select group of industry
leaders. "It's a matter of money and connections," said one source. "There
simply isn't enough to go around."
If such allegations are true then it goes far beyond the terrible events of
recent memory: it is evidence of systemic corruption that rises to the highest
ranks of President Mead's administration, a callous disregard for human life
that must -- and will -- be opposed! -- Joe Greene, Senior Staff Writer

JC DENTON
You still on the dole at UNATCO?

FILBEN
I never mentioned... I've been working for the NSF all along -- and the
Illuminati. I'm on your side.

JC DENTON
Right, the Illuminati. I need to find one of their leaders, Stanton Dowd. A load
of plague virus is on its way to New York.

FILBEN
Virus? You mean the Gray Death? What's Dowd got to do with it?

JC DENTON
The same corporation that makes Ambrosia also manufactures the virus. Quite
convenient. The virus came over in a superfreighter previously owned by Dowd.

FILBEN
Yeah, most of Majestic 12 is just hand-me-downs from the Illuminati. Huh. We
knew about Ambrosia, but the virus... that's news. They're infecting people on
purpose, huh?

JC DENTON
I was hoping Dowd could tell me where the freighter would unload.

FILBEN
I'll contact him. Go to the burnt-up storefront of Osgood and Sons, over where
the tunnels connect to the warehouse district -- you know, where the NSF had the
generator. I'll try to get him to meet you there.

JC DENTON
Osgood and Sons...

FILBEN
Yeah. And, JC... Be careful who you mention the Illuminati to... like Joe
Greene. He's a spy for UNATCO.

JC DENTON
The reporter? Are you sure?

FILBEN
Here's the proof. Hey... Kill Greene and you'll be doing all of us a favor. I
saw him hanging around the free clinic.

(JC DENTON
Already took care of him. I don't like people who ask a lot of questions.

No shit. Man, you really did change sides. Never would've thought it possible.
Thanks for getting rid of that guy.
They're dropping like flies.)

FILBEN
Dowd doesn't like to be contacted directly.

    Nah, UNATCO likes to work alone. Just came out to look up a girl I used to know,
    Sandra Renton. FEMA gave me a pass for the curfew.

JC DENTON
She left town.

VINNY
I know, I know. Just my luck.

JC DENTON
What's FEMA doing handing out travel papers?

VINNY
They took over the Advanced Submarine Base where I work. I don't like being
pushed off-duty, but I guess a little R&R never hurt anyone.

JC DENTON
They brought in their own staff?

VINNY
Most of us were moved out of the main submarine hangar last night... FEMA's set
up a perimeter. We'd sure like to know what's going on in there.

1.  JC DENTON
    I would, too. Maybe I'll check it out for you.

VINNY
You a cop?

JC DENTON
Used to be.

VINNY
I'll say it straight: I'm a patriot. I don't like to see one of our top-secret
bases commandeered, especially when the only people allowed inside are these
Asian mafia-types. You think you can do something about it, I can have my
buddies at the front gate let you slip by. My name's Vinny. Tell 'em you know
me.

JC DENTON
Thanks. I'll see what I can find out.

VINNY
Us Americans, the last of a dying breed... We've got to stick together.
I don't know why we let so many crooks run this country.
We know a cover-up when we see one.

2.  JC DENTON
    I'm sure FEMA has a good reason for the tight security.

VINNY
Yeah, because they know there ain't no emergency and they have no reason to be
out there.

I asked one of the guys, "So what's the emergency? Why's FEMA here?" He said,
"You ask one more question, the emergency's going to be you." That's how they
talk to you.
I saw Walton Simons himself get out of a helicopter on the roof of the hangar.
They gave us all leave because they don't want anybody around tonight.

New York City, just talk about terrorists and martial law -- last thing I saw on

riot gear. It looked like a war. The President came on and said that it was only
temporary, that it was "necessary to protect our way of life," I think that was
it... afterwards one of the other grad students here started making plans to

Beth DuClare Awarded Legion of Honor
APR - Paris, France

Beth DuClare, millionaire, philanthropist, activist -- and famously reputed to
be the mistress of French President Alain Bourges-Maunoury -- was today
posthumously awarded the position of Chevalier in the Ordre Royale de la Legion
D'Honneur. Created by Napoleon Bonaparte on May 19, 1802, the Legion of Honor is
an order of merit to which all qualifying military personnel and civilians can
be nominated without regard to birth or religion, provided that they swear to
uphold liberty and equality.
The award was not without some controversy, as members of the Republican Social
Union for French Democracy (RSUFD) party disputed the merit based on her
involvement in the "Somnolente Ile" scandal that rocked the Serra administration
five years ago.
Beth DuClare passed away in September, found dead at her chateau of natural
causes. She was survived by her daughter, Nicolette DuClare, who has been
missing since her mother's death. Police currently have no leads as to her
whereabouts.
The award was accepted on Beth DuClare's behalf by President Bourges-Maunoury.

I appreciate your update, but I'll be frank with you: the situation is
deteriorating faster than you know, and the Board is completely paralyzed. That
10 million credit donation promised by Page is nowhere to be seen. Two-thirds of
the staff haven't shown up to work in the last few days. Rumors are starting to
surface that there may be a cure for the Gray Death, and what few supply runs
we've managed have been attacked by rioters who think we're hoarding it -- the
media has been absolutely irresponsible, stirring people up into a frenzy.
UNATCO troops set up shop here yesterday, calling the whole thing a
"peacekeeping occupation" and monitoring all medical traffic: when certain
individuals come into any of the clinics for treatment, they're immediately
rounded up. I'm not sure who's running the show anymore.
If you get this message, do whatever you need to do, up to and including
shutting down the clinic. First priority should be the safety of you and your
staff. I'm not sure how we can help anymore.

To All Staff:
The recent terrorist attacks on the city and people of New York -- and the
subsequent declaration of martial law in an attempt to stem the tide of violence
-- has unfortunately created an environment where rumor has supplanted fact as
the currency of information. In an effort to insure that you have the latest,
most accurate news, FEMA will be sending you periodic bulletins; only stories
officially verified and approved by FEMA should be trusted.
First and foremost, I can put an end to one rumor and emphatically state there
is NO cure for the "Gray Death" at present. Government scientists are working
day and night to find a treatment, but any stories referencing a secret
government cure are outright lies of the most vicious sort.

They'll want to hide it. The only facility big enough to the East Coast -- is
the Advanced Submarine Facility at the Brooklyn Naval Shipyards.

Of course. That's why FEMA took it over.

They're probably storing the virus in the ship's diesel tanks. The only way to

JC DENTON
Scuttle a superfreighter?

It can be done -- if you know where to place the charges. Smuggler should have

Crack those up, reverse the bilge pumps, and the ship will split open like a

Tong told me he found an interesting molecular signature on the virus, a clue to
who developed it.
I am certain it was a former member of the Illuminati. The custom among our
scientists was to sign their work -- like painters.
It was a group of conspirators within the Illuminati that formed Majestic 12 to
begin with.
The conspirators were far more ruthless than we were. We couldn't compete.
Majestic 12 realized that technology alone could be a source of political power.
However, the Illuminati laid the foundation... the multinationals, the global
structures Majestic 12 depends upon.
Majestic 12 inherited a system that took millennia to develop.
It's true that our organization stretches back to the Order of the Assassins, or
Hashishim, but not in the way you might imagine.
The order hasn't so much lasted as been continually revived. Adam Weishaupt
started from scratch in Bavaria in 1776. But so did Thomas Jefferson a few years
later. It's the IDEA that has lasted. The SYSTEM.
Or the DESIRE, every thinking person's desire to give the world some decent
organization.
Cecil Rhodes, for instance. Absolutely no formal connection to the Illuminati at
all, but one of the greatest visionaries of centralized power. Now we have the
Rhodes Scholarships, which feed recruits right into the Council on Foreign
Relations... A very powerful tool.
In my opinion, the history of the human race has been one long succession of
conspiracies. To deceive ourselves, we call the successful conspiracies
"governments."
We're running out of time. You better track down the Smuggler.

Terrorist Bombing Kills 35
APR - Hong Kong, China

A terrorist attack on the VersaLife building in Hong Kong has at last count left
35 dead and over a 100 wounded. As authorities continue to search the shattered
structure through the early morning hours, the hope for locating any survivors
among the remaining missing dwindles.
VersaLife, a division of Page Industries (NASDAQ:PAGI), has long been on the
cutting edge of genetic, biological, and pharmaceutical research, virtually
becoming synonymous with treatments for such virulent plagues as AIDS and the
Century Flu. Neither local police nor UNATCO would speculate on possible motives
for such an attack, though both confirmed that it was the result of direct
terrorist action. When reached for comment, VersaLife released a short statement
saying "We are shocked and saddened by this horrible tragedy, but must turn our
attention towards comforting those who have lost a loved one to this senseless
violence."
UNATCO is currently seeking JC Denton, a known terrorist, for questioning.

What kind of operation?

JC DENTON
A manhunt. For me. I don't think you want to get caught in the middle.

SMUGGLER
Thanks for the warning. Come on, let's wrap this up.

SMUGGLER
You telling me the truth about this superfreighter? They're really gonna expose
people to the plague?

JC DENTON
A Marine from the shipyard told me that FEMA's involved. Guess they've gone from
fixing emergencies to making them.

SMUGGLER
If you ask me, I bet FEMA wants to cause a national emergency and get control of
the Army.

JC DENTON
I think we can expect Walton Simons to make a grab for power, one way or
another.

That's all they would need: one national emergency. Then they could get rid of

SOCIETY: Party Against Tomorrow
New York Voice -- Kwesi Dodi

As the rich flee the city in droves by car and -- horror of horrors, bus (needs
must when the devil drives and the airports are closed) -- the rest of us are
left to wallow in the empty crypt that has become our city. The sick and
homeless shamble about as if they just left a casting call for "Night of the
Living Dead," and the cops obviously came from next door where they're filming a
classic 1990's Michael Bay action flick. Really, the whole thing is too much.
And what does Kwesi recommend when it gets to be too much? Why party, of course!
It's not with historical precedent, children. Those of you without zyme-addled
attention spans may remember Boccacio's classic _Decameron_ (and that's Boccacio
the 14th century writer, and not Boccacio the jungle-thud DJ tripmaster), where
a bunch of young, hottie Florentines decided to flee another one of these boring
little plagues and hole up with a few too many bottles of wine, tell outrageous
stories, and have a go at each other once in a while.
So, speaking only for Kwesi, I'm going to invite over about 80 of my nearest and
dearest -- soon to be nearer and dearer -- with all the food and recreational
drugs they can carry, then lock the doors. Good night, children!

DECLARATION OF MARTIAL LAW

Effective immediately, all citizens of New York City are hereby informed that,
at the request of Governor Walpole, President Mead has declared MARTIAL LAW to
be in effect for Manhattan and surrounding boroughs. Until further notice, the
affected areas are under the authority of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration who will work with UNATCO and local law enforcement to eliminate
the terrorist threat that has paralyzed the city in the past week.
"This is an extreme measure -- one undertaken with the utmost gravity -- but it
is necessary step to insure the safety of the citizens of New York," said Walton
Simons, Director of FEMA. "I can only stress that it is a temporary situation
that will be resolved as quickly as possible."
Citizens are advised that a curfew has been instituted from 9PM to 7AM. Further
details will follow.

MOST WANTED: J.C. Denton

Citizens of New York are warned to be on the lookout for terrorist J.C. Denton,
also known as "J.C. Denton." Denton, a terrorist leader, is wanted in
conjunction with a number of crimes including the recent attack on UNATCO
Headquarters; the bombing of the VersaLife building in Hong Kong; and the
murders of Juan Ivanovich Lebedev, UNATCO Agent Anna Navarre, and UNATCO
Director Joseph Manderley.
Denton is approximately six feet tall, with silver facial tattoos and solid blue
eyes, the result of a genetic condition usually concealed by a pair of
sunglasses. He is armed and extremely dangerous. If you believe you have seen or
know someone answering to this description, DO NOT attempt to engage them, but
immediately report them to your nearest FEMA, UNATCO, or police presence.

New Cremation Center

As per FEMA Public Health Directive 27 (PHD27), all bodies are to be cremated
IMMEDIATELY upon expiration. To facilitate this process, a new crematorium has
been opened in Yankee Stadium; however, citizens are asked not to transport
bodies themselves, but to contact the appropriate health officials at
EmergencyServices//NYNET.323.4095 if they require assistance. Failure to comply
with any FEMA Directive is punishable by a minimum sentence of 3 years in jail
and/or a fine of up to c10,000.

Government Shutdowns

Until further notice, all city, state, and county offices are closed, and the
following services suspended:

- Public schools
- Municipal buses
- Garbage service
- Road maintenance
  In addition, all air travel to and from John F. Kennedy International Airport
  and La Guardia has been canceled.

Transit Disruptions

As the result of terrorist action, several subway stations are now closed to
traffic:

- 18th Street
- Battery Park
- York Street
- Clark Street
- High Street
- Queensbridge and Queensboro
- Pelham Green line from Elder to Middleton
  Alternate routes will be posted at or near the affected stations, or can be

  monitored to prevent unauthorized travel and curfew will be observed at all
  stations throughout the greater metropolitan area.

Be careful in there.
The standing orders inside the perimeter are "shoot on sight."
We're supposed to be on red-alert. They even told us to watch the crane so that
no one tries to jump the deck.
Good luck.
FEMA made a big mistake if they think we follow orders blindly.
Just because you have a uniform on, it doesn't mean you don't know how to think

SOLDIER
If I was you, I wouldn't even LOOK at that ship unless I was damn sure I was

JC DENTON
I'm late. Let me pass.

SOLDIER
The gate stays closed. Actually, our orders are to shoot anyone who tries to get
in. We won't go that far, but don't expect a warm reception inside the
perimeter.
The FEMA people left strict orders: no visitors.
If you snoop around, you're just going to get yourself shot.
I'll be glad when this all blows over.
I'm not sticking my neck out for one of Page's page-boys, assuming you're who

You should have been on time for your meeting.
We don't like what you people are doing in there.
We don't like how FEMA thinks they can negotiate with a foreign power. They
can't.

Search for Terrorist Leader Intensifies
APR - New York

UNATCO is working closely with FEMA and other international security agencies
around the world to apprehend JC Denton, a terrorist with ties to a number of
groups including the NSF, Silhouette, and organized crime in Hong Kong.
"We believe him to be responsible for organizing and leading the attack on
Liberty Island and the deaths of a number of UNATCO agents," said Walton Simons,
Director of FEMA. "The necessity of instituting martial law in New York --
unheard of in the history of America -- is directly attributable to criminal
elements operating under his orders."
Simons went to say that evidence recovered from the recent bombing of the
VersaLife building in Hong Kong demonstrates JC Denton's involvement "beyond a
shadow of a doubt" and points towards an organized, systematic campaign of
terror designed to "extort freedom for politically dangerous ideologies through
any means necessary."
Authorities are also seeking any information on the whereabouts of Alex Jacobson
or Brian "Jock" Flanagan, key figures in the terrorist organization.

Page Unveils "Aquinas"
APR - Washington, D.C.

At a lavish press conference today attended by mainstream and technical media
alike, Bob Page unveiled Page Industries (NASDAQ: PAGI) newest technological
achievement, "Aquinas." Rumored to have been in development for almost five
years at a cost of over billion credits, Aquinas is a seamless, transparent
replacement for the current patchwork of Net protocols that promises to
radically expand bandwidth without the need for new hardware.
"Aquinas is the result of over five hundred man-years of effort on the part of
some of the most talented and driven people in the industry," Page said at the
conference. "We're grateful to the NSA and the Hague Commission on Secure
Communications for trusting Page Industries with the responsibilities for this
technological milestone. As of noon today you can expect nearly all of the
world's net traffic to be carried by Aquinas. Bandwidth is now, for all intents
and purposes, free."
The remainder of the press conference involved presentations by the leaders of
the carriers allied with Page Industries, and a technical discussion of the
Aquinas Protocol -- named after the titular Thomas Aquinas, whose philosophy is
a well-known passion for Bob Page.

Family Discovers New Species
New World Press - New York

The Caruthers family was enjoying a pleasant walk down a stretch of unremarkable
SoCal beach when they encountered what may be a most remarkable scientific
discovery.
"It was my wife who spotted it first," said Dane Caruthers. "At first we thought
it was a lizard that'd drowned and washed ashore, but it was too big -- it had
this gigantic head and feathers on its arms, but it didn't look like any bird
I'd ever seen. Then I thought it might be like one of those prehistoric fish
that everyone thought was extinct, so I decided to call someone."
The strange carcass eventually found its way to the Biology Department of the
University of California, Los Angeles, where it was examined by Dr. Trey
Hermann. "A preliminary study indicates that it doesn't really fit any of our
current taxonomies," Dr. Hermann said. "It seems to have certain superficial
characteristics of a seagull, but with a considerable number of other, more
reptilian traits."
The Caruthers family seemed to take it all in stride. "Though I have to admit I
was a little excited when Dr. Hermann said they might name it after us," said
Mr. Caruthers.

Jacob's Shadow

Chapter 23

There weren't many moves left. Jacob knew that. Most of the pawns had been taken
off the board and his own queen lost. The game had entered its final phase, and
now the question wasn't which piece to sacrifice -- they were all more or less
expendable -- but when.
He shined his flashlight throughout the rooms of the vacant house. It was a
perfectly serviceable tract home somewhere in the suburbs where the sun
occasionally shone. It looked like no one had lived there for ages, and that was
true enough. Jacob just took care of the bills -- any paper trail ended at

In the attic he found the old water heater, cold now. He removed the top and
felt along the edge for a nearly invisible strand of fishing line. Jacob hauled
back on the line until he pulled a dripping plastic bag free of the murky tank.
He took the flashlight between his teeth and opened the bag.
Inside was a gun, a clean gun. Its serial numbers filed and the rifling
scratched beyond any possible match. The bullets all reloads with blank copper
casings. No fingerprints.
Time for the next move.

virus.

    Not really. Think I should check it out?

Oh, don't mind my paranoia. Occupational hazard. I'm sure he has his business.

He seemed harmless. Anyway, I scuttled the freighter and destroyed the stockpile

Excellent, my friend. We have them on the run.

DOWD
Ambrosia... You found some.

    You sound pretty bad. I'm sorry, but... I didn't manage to retrieve any
    Ambrosia.

DOWD
No bother.

JC DENTON
Mr. Dowd, tell me something. Someone calling himself Daedalus has been
broadcasting to my infolink. He wants me to go to Paris to find an associate of
yours, Morgan Everett.

DOWD
Yes, yes... Everett. We need his help to develop a cure. Who is this Daedalus?

JC DENTON
I don't know... He seems to be an ally. But if your friend doesn't want to be
found --

DOWD
At this stage, we might be out of options. You see, I was able to decipher the
molecular signatures Tracer Tong found, and it turns out Everett was the one who
developed the eutatic component of the virus.

JC DENTON
He developed the virus for the Illuminati?

DOWD
Not exactly. The work was on augmentations. It was Bob Page who wanted to
develop it into a weapon. Tong found Page's signature on the virus as well.

JC DENTON
Page... the billionaire. How does he relate to Majestic 12?

DOWD
He was among the original group of Illuminati who broke off to form Majestic 12.
Not so good at the science, though... he must be directing operations.

JC DENTON
So Everett should be able to reverse-engineer Page's modifications... and help
find a cure.

DOWD
Exactly.

JC DENTON
Daedalus said I should find Nicolette DuClare first.

DOWD
Yes, Everett is close to the DuClares. My suggestion, too. Unfortunately, I've
lost touch with the Paris crowd.

JC DENTON
How do I find Nicolette?

DOWD
She's a member of the French terrorist group Silhouette, last I heard. They're
rumored to meet in the Paris catacombs.

JC DENTON
Great. I'll have Jock drop me off near the catacombs.

DOWD
I'll give you what I have on Nicolette. It's not much -- just a few snapshots of
the catacombs area.

JC DENTON
Thanks. I'm sure they will be helpful.

DOWD
Bob Page was Morgan Everett's protege, a good student but very impatient.
When one of Page's plates was contaminated, he would smash everything in his
cubicle with a ball-peen hammer.
Should have guessed he would go bad.
Page resisted the "degrees of Illuminism," as they were implemented. Never made
it past "Master of Tyre."
He would sleep through the Hatha Yoga exercises in the morning, so it became
impossible for him to advance.
With Majestic 12, from what I can tell, he's replaced the degrees with a
hierarchy of security clearances -- same structure, only secular.
He names the various clearances after angels, though. I find that ironic.
A bright man. Understands the origins of loyalty. Advancement through the layers
of secrecy provides incentives for recruits to perform well.
Don't underestimate the allure of a well-kept secret. Our organization lasted
from the Crusades to the early 21st century, and our only secret was a technique
of meditation, a way of imaging your body dissolving into light.
If you want to know about Page, ask Everett when you get to Paris. They were
like father and son, once.
You better get moving.

Subject: Humble Request

Mr. Dowd, I have long enjoyed our acquaintance and the many rewarding
conversations we have had since first meeting. I must apologize, then, if what I
now ask strays beyond the boundaries of that relationship, but I feel we are in
a position to benefit not just each other, but to avert a terrible tragedy from
befalling all the peoples of the world.
I am sending an associate of mine to New York; I hope you will take the
opportunity to meet with him. Through his efforts we have uncovered some clues
to the nature of the "Gray Death" virus: it is artificially created, and appears
to be connected to the Illuminati in some fashion -- or someone wishes us to
believe that it is. Those responsible for the virus are delivering a shipment to
New York aboard a superfreighter previously owned by you, currently registered
as the "PRCS Wall Cloud." No doubt the virus will be used to infect thousands
more in an effort to create fear and confusion.
Any assistance you could give my associate and I in preventing the virus from
being released will save untold lives.
My most humble thanks, and I hope this will find you in good health.

The Man Who Was Thursday

..."Professor," he cried, "it is intolerable. Are you afraid of this man?"
The Professor lifted his heavy lids, and gazed at Syme with large, wide-open,
blue eyes of an almost ethereal honesty. "Yes, I am," he said mildly. "So are
you."
Syme was dumb for an instant. Then he rose to his feet erect, like an insulted
man, and thrust the chair away from him.
"Yes," he said in a voice indescribable, "you are right. I am afraid of him.
Therefore I swear by God that I will seek out this man whom I fear until I find
him, and strike him on the mouth. If heaven were his throne and the earth his
footstool, I swear that I would pull him down."
"How?" asked the staring Professor. "Why?"
"Because I am afraid of him," said Syme; "and no man should leave in the
universe anything of which he is afraid..."

NEWSPAPER

Catacombs Closed to Public
Paris Investigateur

The government announced today that the famous Paris Catacombs would be closed
to the public until further notice, citing increased criminal activity and
possible terrorist connections to the area. "The Catacombs have become a haven
for any number of unseemly elements," said Inspector Gabily of the Metropolitan
Police, "and we are taking all necessary steps to contain this threat to the
peace and welfare of Paris citizens."
The Catacombs are part of an extensive network of tunnels that mostly lie
beneath the 5th, 6th, and 14th arrondissements, originally part of larger
excavations undertaken by the Romans to remove valuable deposits of gypsum and
limestone from the area. The Catacombs themselves date back to 1786 when bones
were removed from the grossly overcrowded Cemetery of Innocents to be stored in
the quarries of Mont-Rouge; since that time, innumerable additional burials have
resulted in the vast ossuary that exists today.
The publicly accessible sections of the Catacombs are only a small part of the
complete tunnel system whose many entrances and exits have made it a popular
diversion for cataphiles wishing to explore the underground history of the city.

Maybe I can help you out, in exchange for a small favor. I need to find
Nicolette DuClare.

CHAD
Nicolette?.... What do you want with Nicolette?

JC DENTON
I need to contact some friends of her mother's.

CHAD
Ah, yes, Beth... a great woman. Nicolette is very secretive about her mother's
friends. She tells us that they are wealthy and support our cause, but they have
many enemies and need to be protected. I might be able to help you, but I must
be certain of your loyalty.

JC DENTON
You have a right to be cautious. Just point me to Bunker 03.

CHAD
I have a key to the blast door, which is directly across from the hideout. And a
map you might find useful. Get my people back, and I will put you in touch with
Nicolette.
It is unfortunate I cannot send someone with you.
My people are simply not the best soldiers.
We train teams to wire buildings with C4. They go in at night to avoid
confrontation. In a straight fight against commandos... they just don't have the
equipment or expertise.
I can't bear to imagine what methods of interrogation Majestic 12 will use on my
people.
Silhouette is not a military group. Our attacks are symbolic, intended to
influence the public.
We publicize certain things, like the Statue of Liberty bombing. It's just so
fitting that the American government would destroy the gift of freedom we gave
your country almost 200 years ago -- and then try to blame it on us!
The rhetoric in Washington has done more to defeat liberty than all the armies
and police forces in the world.
When government surveillance and intimidation is called "freedom from terrorism"
or "liberation from crime," freedom and liberty have become words without
meanings.
I know Majestic 12; when they have learned what they can, they will execute
every last one of the prisoners.
This war all around us is being fought over the very meanings of words.
Just as Bakhtin described the novel as a competition between various
"languages," so we describe culture itself, which thrives upon convulsion and
upheaval.
Culture, by definition a shared territory of meaning, inspires conflicts far
more destructive than any dispute over territory on the Earth's surface.
Meaning does not exist a priori. It is order imposed by individuals with
arsenals of communication devices.
Every inscription, every utterance, every gesture seeks to dominate the plain of
meaning.
Real violence is only an extension of this process.
In order to get our own message before the public, we too have been violent. We
have even killed people.
But it is the message -- the communication EVENT -- that we target, not a few
human beings, or a building, or an historical landmark.
If you expect to help my people, you should get moving.

Trust me; your people will be all right.

CHAD
Yes... Yes, of course. Thank you so much.

CHAD
Now... You wanted to contact Nicolette.

JC DENTON
Yes.

CHAD
You might catch her at Club La Porte de l'Enfer. I try to tell her it's not
safe, but ever since her mother's assassination she has been careless. She goes
out every night as though daring the assassins to show their faces.

JC DENTON
A Silhouette hangout?

CHAD
Among other things. But you can't get there at night. The roads are blocked.

JC DENTON
What about the tunnels?

CHAD
The catacombs do not go that far. You might try the sewers, though. They can be
reached through the rear blast door.

JC DENTON
Is it locked?

CHAD
Unfortunately. MJ12 closed it before the raid; maybe you can find a key on one
of the soldiers.

1.  JC DENTON
    I already picked up that key. Thanks again for the help.

2.  JC DENTON
    The soldiers... Good idea. I haven't come across that key yet.

CHAD
Nicolette has been somewhat mysterious about her reasons for supporting us. I do
not pretend to understand her.
Through her mother's estate, she has provided Silhouette with immense amounts of
funding.
I am reluctant to believe her patronage is entirely benign.
What inclines me to trust Nicolette, however, is that her mother's death six
months ago -- we are fairly certain -- was the work of Majestic 12.
My impression is that Nicolette supports us against Majestic 12 but that she
will have her own agenda when the fighting is over.
I wish Nicolette would be more sensible. She should find a place to hide and
stay there.
Beth DuClare was the only one of our wealthy supporters whom we referred to by
name, and she was the one who got killed. We have learned to keep our mouths
shut.

the Champs-Elysées is a bustling street of boutiques and government offices, but
it is only at night that it comes truly alive, a place of cafes and clubs, of

Bot Kills Three in Accidental Shooting
APR - Paris, France

Yves-Pierre Adrien, Dominique Vittet, and Marie Philibert were heading home from
a late night on the town when they were gunned down in the street by a military
robot that mistakenly identified them as terrorists. Since the institution of
martial law in Paris, bots have regularly patrolled those areas with a high
level of criminal activity, armed with a visual database profiling thousands of
wanted terrorists, thieves, and drug dealers.
"It was awful," said Kristi Amiel. A waitress at Enfant Terrible -- a nearby
cafe where the trio had their last cup of coffee -- she was witness to the
shooting. "The bot just kept shooting and shooting until all you could hear was
an empty clicking sound, then one of the soldiers ran into the control station
across the street trying to shut it down, but nothing happened. It just kept
clicking... trying to shoot them again."
Police Prefect Hubert Dupuy defended the practice during a news conference
earlier today. "The bots are programmed to only use lethal force if the suspects
resist arrest, and while these deaths are tragedies to be mourned, it in no way
compromises the effectiveness of bots in keeping Parisians safe."

Remember: I always pay a fair price.

Petals of Twilight
by Charles Francois Guillermot

...And it is told that he made his way through their streets
at night, crawling through their many windows and crouching in
their gardens, moving
through the sewers beneath their cobbled roads and
slipping over their railings.
Watched by their cats and the roosting pidgeons of their city,
yet wary of their slumbering dogs, he went. They would not see
him, nor wake as he drew near,
but would only shudder, softly calling out the names of their
gods in sleep.
Restless, they tossed as he passed under the window like an errant lover fleeing
dawn.
And by morning light he was gone, away from that place, and
moved on to another

Common Sense
by Thomas Paine

...SOME writers have so confounded society with government, as to leave little
or no distinction between them; whereas they are not only different, but have
different origins. Society is produced by our wants, and government by
wickedness; the former promotes our happiness positively by uniting our
affections, the latter negatively by restraining our vices. The one encourages
intercourse, the other creates distinctions. The first is a patron, the last a
punisher.
Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is
but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one; for when we suffer,
or are exposed to the same miseries by a government, which we might expect in a
country without government, our calamity is heightened by reflecting that we
furnish the means by which we suffer. Government, like dress, is the badge of
lost innocence; the palaces of kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of
paradise. For were the impulses of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly
obeyed, man would need no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds
it necessary to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the
protection of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which
in every other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least...

INTERPOL WANTED: J.C. Denton

Interpol is currently seeking the whereabouts of a known terrorist J.C. Denton.
Denton is wanted for a number of international crimes including theft, murder,
money laundering, drug trafficking, and destruction of property. Denton was last
believed to have been sighted in New York, but recent information indicates that
he may currently be operating in Paris.
Denton is approximately six feet tall, with silver facial tattoos and solid blue
eyes -- the result of a rare genetic condition that he often conceals with a
pair of sunglasses. Denton is extremely dangerous and should NOT be approached.
Instead, if you believe you have seen him, contact your nearest police or
security representative. There is currently a reward of c10,000 for information
that leads to his capture or arrest.
Interpol is also attempting to locate Alex Jacobson and Jaime Reyes for
questioning in a number of related incidents. No descriptions are available at
this time, but will be posted as they become available.

Lies? TRUTH!
Citizens of Paris, did you even turn in your sleep as your freedom was seized
from you? Did you hear them when they told you it was done in your name? Or did
you simply wake from your dream and never question the reality of your slavery?
The City of Lights has been extinguished by Shadows. Our government has been
taken from us. We live in fear of jack-booted troops and hulking, clanking tools
of oppression, afraid to travel from one arrondissement to another. Where is the
city of our dreams? The Pigalle has become the grave for our buried joy, the
Champs-Elysées rings of nothing but the dirge of our forgotten hopes.
We let this happen, we _all_ let this happen -- but it is not too late! We are
free in our hearts and our minds, and it is there that true rebellion must
begin. Look to those who would unify us only to enslave us. Look to those who
would make us rich but rob our souls. Look to those who would protect our safety
by stealing our liberty. Question everything. Believe nothing. Take action in
the places they cannot see and they can never conquer us.

Police Raid Catacombs
Paris Investigateur

Earlier today the police raided the Catacombs, entering through Denfert-
Rochereau, Port Royal, Trocadero, and a number of other, unidentified locations,
in an attempt to round up elements of the terrorist group Silhouette. Sources
within the Metropolitan Police Department indicated that since the institution
of martial law the number of terrorist incidents has declined, but Silhouette
still remains active in its so-called "Campaign of True Lies."
"Far from being a harmless group of reactionaries, Silhouette presents a clear
and ongoing threat to the public welfare," said Inspector Gabily, currently
leading the case.
Despite extensive surveillance prior to the raid, however, police found minimal
evidence of Silhouette's presence, instead capturing a number of drug dealers,
prostitutes, and other suspected criminals. "All in all, we consider the
operation a success," insisted Gabily. "We've made a strong statement that Paris
-- above or below -- will not be a haven to radicals and thieves."

Somnolente Ile Scandal Resurfaces

Accusations of cover-ups within President Bourges-Manoury's administration have
recently appeared in several tabloid publications, linking key members of his
Council of Ministers to the Somnolente Ile scandal that resulted in President
Serra's exit from politics five years ago. Somnolente Ile, an exclusive resort
in Cote d'Azur, was the site of a clandestine meeting between then President
Serra and reputed members of the Zuganov crime family in an attempt to funnel
almost three billion credits of tainted money through French banks.
The deal was reportedly brokered by a cabal of major banking interests --
including deceased financier Beth DuClare, though her involvement was never
proved. Some sources went so far as to suggest that the entire meeting was the
result of a plot hatched by the "Bilderbergs," a supposedly secret society
formed of wealthy and powerful industrialists shortly after World War II.
President Bourges-Manoury has dismissed the accusations as "ludicrous," calling
such stories "the lowest example of irresponsible journalism" before refusing
further comment.

CONVERSATION: JAIME REYES

JAIME REYES
Thought you could run for a weekend in Paris without me, huh?

JC DENTON
Call me nostalgic, but the nightlife seems to have lost its old charm.

JAIME REYES
Yes, but I didn't trust anyone else to deliver this warning, not even Alex or
Tong.

JC DENTON
What happened at UNATCO?

JAIME REYES
They intercepted a message Alex sent to my home account, instructions on how to
find him in Hong Kong.

JC DENTON
I hope the message was encrypted.

JAIME REYES
I destroyed my keystore. Tong is safe. But they've been tracking you with an IA
program. They've sent Gunther to assassinate you in Paris.

JC DENTON
Icarus...

JAIME REYES
However, you don't have to find Gunther -- or any other mechanically augmented
agent.

JC DENTON
I'm prepared for a fight.

JAIME REYES
UNATCO never trusted its augmented agents. Any mech can be stopped in its tracks
with a secret killphrase.

JC DENTON
Kill-somethings were standard issue, I gather.

JAIME REYES
Gunther's is "Laputan machine". Dug that out of the medical records before I
left.

JC DENTON
Laputan machine. Easy enough. Thanks for looking out for me, staying at the
agency and all.

JAIME REYES
Don't mention it.
At the sound of your voice, 400 milliamps will discharge into Gunther's
midbrain. Poof!
I wasn't the only one who got purged. Carter's gone also.
"Questionable loyalty." Can you believe that? CARTER?
I think Simons was afraid he knew too much.
All of the older guys were let go. Anyone with non-UNATCO experience.
Carter told me he was going to contact Gary Savage of the X-51 researchers.
I don't know how they know each other, but Carter said, "Savage is right; it's
time to do something with Area 51."
You know Carter, taciturn as ever. Who knows what he was talking about.
I'm going to stay here until the soldiers calm down.
I saw Gunther leave the club a few hours ago; I heard he was asking about you.
Be careful, JC.

CONVERSATION: JOSHUA, AGATHE & JON

JOSHUA
He's our son. We can't have him murdering people for this -- this -- Majestic 12.

AGATHE
He's not a child anymore.

JOSHUA
This CULT.

AGATHE
At least he has a position. He's SAFE.

JOSHUA
Any organization with anonymous leadership...

AGATHE
They might control Europe for decades. Michel will have to survive somehow.

JOSHUA
I would rather he die with the rest of us.

AGATHE
Joshua!
First and in your heart you are a father. How dare you let politics --

JOSHUA
I am a Frenchman.

AGATHE
You have abandoned your own son.

JOSHUA
Perhaps I want to take the metro to see my mother, yes? Should I forget Mother -

- and my own freedom to travel -- so that Michel can have a small salary?

AGATHE
There are difficult times. I don't deny it...

JOSHUA
He and his new friends murdered the Loredans simply because the old man ran a
journal. Next time, he will come to murder us.

JC DENTON
I couldn't help overhearing about your son.

JOSHUA
They have us, yes... Majestic 12, whoever they are... When you have the youth,
you have everything.

AGATHE
Joshua, be careful. You don't know this man.

JOSHUA
I will not hide under a rock!

JC DENTON
You have nothing to fear. I would like to see the end of Majestic 12 as much as
you would. I was just surprised to find a Parisian who has heard the name.

JOSHUA
Well... my son, you know. I learn what I can about him.

JC DENTON
What else have you found out?

JOSHUA
You are one of the revolutionaries, eh? Maybe you can do something with this:
"streetstation17" and "werewolf" -- from a card in his wallet. I think it is the
login for the guard shack up the street.

AGATHE
What about Michel? You'll get him killed.

JOSHUA
He was the one who wanted to be a soldier.
That is what I know.
I have helped you to kill my own son. It is that not enough?
I said go!
(I don't know you. Leave me alone.
I am not in the mood for talking.
What is your problem?)

AGATHE
You've done enough. Go.
Oh, poor Michel...
If you see him... tall, you know, dark hair... don't shoot. He's our child.
I know they all look the same in those uniforms...

JON
Bonjour monsieur.
Papa forbids me to talk to strangers.
Leave me alone.

CONVERSATION: LOUIS

LOUIS
Three hundred credits.

1.  JC DENTON
    Here you go.

LOUIS
He is the key. It will be valid for this evening only.
We are forced to let anybody in, because business is so slow.
Next time you might not be so lucky.
I am tired of seeing your face.

2.  JC DENTON
    No thanks.

LOUIS
You are not our first choice of customer, either.

(CONVERSATION: LOUIS

LOUIS
Get out!
What are you doing?
Out! I mean it!
You like the nurse, eh?

JC DENTON
The nurse on the platform? She's all right.

LOUIS
You stay away from her. Camille is a good woman.

JC DENTON
What am I, then? Bad?

LOUIS
You sneak into places you don't belong without paying. Eh? Am I right? A
criminal! Give me the 300 credits or I call the police!
(You sneaky swine. Pay the three-hundred credit cover or I will report you to
the police.)

1.  JC DENTON
    Please accept my apology. Here you are.

LOUIS
I spit on your apology, but I will accept your money. Do not try that again.
You think you're so smart.
Ha! You will get yourself killed!
Go!

2.  JC DENTON
    Make me.

LOUIS
No! You -- you will pay! I will make you pay!)

CONVERSATION: CLUB SECURITY

CLUB SECURITY
Please keep your weapons concealed.
Obey the rules and enjoy yourself.
No fighting.
Get a drink, relax, and enjoy yourself.
The people who come here prefer to be left alone.
Mr. Tarot asks that I do not talk to guests.

CONVERSATION: JEAN

JEAN
Qu'est-ce que je vous sers?

JC DENTON
Thin crowd. Has martial law hurt business?

JEAN
Hurt business? HURT BUSINESS? You can't even get on the metro. How can you get
to the club without the metro?

JC DENTON
I came through the catacombs.

JEAN
Oui! Oui! The only way is to crawl on your belly like a stinking rat. That's all
we get: stinking rats!

JC DENTON
Silhouette members, you mean.

JEAN
Rats! And the Gestapo! And THEY want free drinks!

JC DENTON
Gestapo?

JEAN
Not French soldiers. Some of them don't even speak French!

JC DENTON
The troops at the metro?

JEAN
Oui! There was a coup. We see the President only on video recording, and sweat
is dripping from his mustache because -- it is obvious -- someone is pointing a
gun at his head!

JC DENTON
You might be right about that.
(Never mind.)
Ten credits' worth of food.

JEAN
Ten credits of nanite-enriched chocolate.

JC DENTON
The best wine you've got for 120.

JEAN
This is what we have.

(JEAN
What is the matter?

JC DENTON
Sorry... no room. I can't carry anything else.)

CONVERSATION: ARTHUR

Loosen up...

CONVERSATION: KATARINA

KATARINA
Pissy night, huh?
This place used to be a party.
People don't go out anymore. Even my friends in the Champs Elysées.
The coup is such a drag.
There's nothing to do anymore.

CONVERSATION: NURSE DANCER CAMILLE

CAMILLE
Hi, baby. What's your name?

JC DENTON
JC.

CAMILLE
Mmmm. Mysterious. Want to know my initials?

JC DENTON
How 'bout you tell me something about the people who come here.

CAMILLE
Anything you like, cutie. Twenty credits.

1.  JC DENTON
    Okay.

CAMILLE
So who do you want to find?

JC DENTON
What can you tell me about Nicolette DuClare?

CAMILLE
I see now. You are in love. You poor man. She has already given her heart to one
of the revolutionaries.

JC DENTON
I'm not in love. Could you tell me if she's here?

CAMILLE
You have a look, yes, a tough-guy look, but you cannot compare to a real
revolutionary. They have their own private society upstairs. You will be happier
down here. Another twenty credits?

JC DENTON
Sure.

2.  JC DENTON
    Sorry.

CAMILLE
Change your mind? Have that twenty credits?

JC DENTON
Sure.

CAMILLE
I can tell you about Antoine, the thief.

JC DENTON
Go ahead. Should I be keeping an eye on my credit chits?

CAMILLE
He pretends to be a big-time smuggler, but really he just steals things from the
augmentation clinic where his mother works.

JC DENTON
Everyone's got to start somewhere, I guess.

CAMILLE
You will find him lurking in a dark corner. I bet he will try to sell you
something. Am I telling you what you want to know? Can I have another twenty
credits?

JC DENTON
Sure.

CAMILLE
Who next... Jocques, the accountant?

JC DENTON
I'm not picky. Tell me about Jocques.

CAMILLE
He grew up here in the Champs-Elysées. He knows everybody. If you're looking for
a particular person...

JC DENTON
Where do I find him?

CAMILLE
He is in the office behind the south bar. What do you say? Another twenty
credits?

JC DENTON
Sure.

CAMILLE
This time I tell you about myself.

JC DENTON
Okay...

CAMILLE
My name is Camille. I'm a writer.

JC DENTON
Yeah? What are you doing in a place like this?

CAMILLE
I'm working on a novel. If I dress up like a nurse twice a week, I make enough
money to write the other five days.

JC DENTON
Not bad...

CAMILLE
Funny how the traffic of credits brings our dreams and fantasies to life; every
transaction is like a small prayer... If so many men have a thing for nurses,
you can be sure someone will be standing right where I am, collecting the
offerings.

JC DENTON
Well, I was buying information.

CAMILLE
Sure, baby, if you say so. But if my novel ever gets published -- that would be
four hundred pages of pure information -- think you would put down the ten
credits to get it?

JC DENTON
I'm not much into books.

CAMILLE
You have to share...
I must amuse the others now.
Come again! Same time next week...

CONVERSATION: ANTOINE

ANTOINE
Hello. Tough guy.

JC DENTON
You talking to me?

ANTOINE
You use bioelectric devices, yes? Manufacture steroids in your muscles?

JC DENTON
Nothing as crude as that.

ANTOINE
But, yes, you would be interested in a bioelectric cell for 250 credits.

JC DENTON
No thanks.

ANTOINE
Yes! You are interested! One bioelectric cell, 250 credits.

JC DENTON
I'll take one.

ANTOINE
You want more, ask for me, Antoine.
Another bioelectric cell? 250 credits.

JC DENTON
I'll take one.
(I can't carry anything else. Hold on, I'll go through my junk.)

ANTOINE
Everyone needs batteries, yes?
Another bioelectric cell? 250 credits.

JC DENTON
I'll take one.

ANTOINE
Very good.
Sorry -- I am out of energy devices.
Come back again in a few days.
I am always sitting right here.

CONVERSATION: CHARLOTTE & ANNETTE

CHARLOTTE
Chad's dead.

ANNETTE
No...

CHARLOTTE
The police are making a clean sweep through the catacombs. He can't hide.

ANNETTE
Silhouette knows what to do in these situations.

CHARLOTTE
I told him this would happen, but he would not let go of his Voltaire delusions.

ANNETTE
Maybe he IS a Voltaire. We don't know.

CHARLOTTE
WAS Voltaire.

ANNETTE
Chad knows exactly what he is doing. He will be a great hero in French history.

CHARLOTTE
A martyr, maybe, not a philosophe.

ANNETTE
He's quoted all over the world.

CHARLOTTE
Slogans, antics, no Contrat social.

ANNETTE
Ideas take many forms.

CHARLOTTE
He recycles the past. It is nothing special to be a reactionary who tries to
revive the same old rhetoric.

ANNETTE
Political freedom is "rhetoric?"

CHARLOTTE
A necessary deception of the industrial age.

ANNETTE
A realization, rather, of the value of human life.

CHARLOTTE
Human life was valuable only in one sense. Suddenly any person was a unit of
labor in the factory system, roughly equivalent to all others, and was therefore
a transferable resource.

ANNETTE
It was the greatest age this planet has ever seen. The age of invention, of
self-reliance, of the individual artist.

CHARLOTTE
And transferable resources must be free to move about, in response to market
forces. That's "freedom." Now that most people don't produce anything of value -

-

ANNETTE
We're talking about the inherent worth of an individual, not economic utility.

CHARLOTTE
Now that only a few people create wealth -- the scientists, engineers, bankers,
and so on -- we require an arrangement of the few over the inert mass the rest
of us have become.

ANNETTE
A nation's government does not have to bow down beneath economic laws.

CHARLOTTE
That is where we differ. I believe the evolution is always in that direction.

JC DENTON
I have some good news for both of you. Chad's alive.

ANNETTE
You've seen him? Where? Is he okay?

CHARLOTTE
An American accent... What business do you have with Silhouette?

JC DENTON
My business is with the terrorists who control the French government. They're
planning the same in my own country.

CHARLOTTE
What would L'Armée De Terre want with America?

JC DENTON
The French army had nothing to do with the coup. It was an international
paramilitary group called Majestic 12.

ANNETTE
What about Chad? How is he?

JC DENTON
His hideout is secure. I'm going to meet up with a friend of his named Nicolette
DuClare. She can lead me to a powerful enemy of the conspirators.

1.  ANNETTE
    Nicolette -- oh, yeah, she's here. She --

CHARLOTTE
She does not want to be found.

JC DENTON
You know her?

CHARLOTTE
She realizes how foolish is to antagonize the government and has gone into
hiding.
Nicolette is in enough trouble as it is.
Leave us alone.

ANNETTE
My friend is right. Nicolette told us not to trust anyone.
I'm sorry.

2.  ANNETTE
    You know Nicolette?

JC DENTON
Her friend has arranged for me to meet her.

CHARLOTTE
You will only get yourself arrested. Stay away from Miss DuClare.

ANNETTE
You're serious about the conspiracy, huh?
I still think it's just the military.
You'd better not get Nicolette in trouble with the authorities.

CHARLOTTE
I cannot believe she would trust you.
You must be lying.
Leave us alone.

(ANNETTE
How rude!
Leave me alone!
I am not afraid of you.

CHARLOTTE
Stay away from me!
Don't make me call security!
I said leave me alone.)

CONVERSATION: MICHELLE

MICHELLE
What will it be? A snack for 10 credits, wine for 120.

JC DENTON
Know the name Nicolette DuClare?

MICHELLE
What do you want with Miss DuClare?

JC DENTON
A private matter.

MICHELLE
This club has good security. You try something, you won't be arrested. You will
be dead.

JC DENTON
I'm a friend of hers.

MICHELLE
She would have told me to expect you.

JC DENTON
What do you think of Silhouette?

MICHELLE
They have the right idea, but they are weak.

JC DENTON
Do they have much popular support?

MICHELLE
The people are ready to fight. Foreign troops go down the street every day, not
even afraid of being seen.

JC DENTON
The group that has occupied the chancellerie is called Majestic 12. They control
the United Nations and plot against other governments as well.

MICHELLE
What we need is an army. Silhouette should be organizing resistance, not
spreading around slogans everybody already agrees with.

1.  JC DENTON
    A bottle of wine.

MICHELLE
Tenez.

2.  JC DENTON
    A snack.

    2.1
    MICHELLE
    Bon appetit.

    2.2
    MICHELLE
    Certainly.

(3.
JC DENTON
Never mind.)

CONVERSATION: JACQUES

JC DENTON
You work here?

JACQUES
The bartender will help you. I am the accountant.

JC DENTON
Just a few questions. Have you heard of Silhouette?

JACQUES
So... you're in that game. Don't say a word; I don't want to know. But for 1,000
credits I'll give you the address of an arms smuggler who is out of town. Do you
need guns?

1.  JC DENTON
    Okay.

JACQUES
His apartment is down the street, Building 11.

JC DENTON
Does he have security?

JACQUES
Of course. But it will be worth it. Trust me.
I am your man.
No more talking.
What we do not know about you, we cannot tell the authorities.

2.  JC DENTON
    No way.

JACQUES
Talk to me again. I am our man.
Change your mind? You have 1,000 credits to learn the location of the most
advanced weapons?

CONVERSATION: CASSANDRA

CASSANDRA
Have a light?

JC DENTON
I don't smoke.

CASSANDRA
What's your name?

JC DENTON
I'm a little busy right now.

CASSANDRA
Hey, can I ask a favor? I'm out of money. Have any spare chits?

JC DENTON
How does someone with no money get into a club with a 300-credit cover charge?

CASSANDRA
My friends work here.

JC DENTON
Then you must know all about the place.

CASSANDRA
Oh, yes, I used to work in the office. I could tell you anything. How about 200
credits? I could give you the code to the saferoom.

1.  JC DENTON
    Sure.

CASSANDRA
It's just a little room with a keypad back where the offices are. The code's 1966.

JC DENTON
Thanks.

CASSANDRA
They never change the code. Idiots.
As far as I'm concerned, this place could burn down.
They said I was stealing, which isn't true. Everybody else was doing exactly the
same thing.
They pay you NOTHING to work here. You can't even LIVE on it.
I hope Mr. Tarot tries to throw me out. I'd like to see him try!
Great jacket. Trés chic.

2.  JC DENTON
    Sorry.

3.  JC DENTON
    See you around.

2-3.1
CASSANDRA
It would be worth it. Trust me.
Come on. 200 credits. You will find much more than that in the saferoom.

4.  JC DENTON
    What about Nicolette DuClare? Know her?

CASSANDRA
I don't want to get mixed up in any of that. I stay out of other people's
business.

JC DENTON
Mixed up in what?

CASSANDRA
You know, how they used to steal sunglasses from the street cops or run by with
scissors and cut off their ties? That kind of thing -- always calling attention
to themselves.

JC DENTON
You mean, Silhouette? I think they were trying to save Paris from exactly what's
going on right now.

CASSANDRA
Funny way of doing it. And pretty dangerous. Once people know who you are, you
can be killed, just like that. Just like Nicolette's mother. Enough! I'm not
saying her name again.

5.  JC DENTON
    Already been there.

CASSANDRA
Are you sure?

JC DENTON
I broke in myself. Looks like that code isn't gonna be as valuable as you
thought.

CASSANDRA
Oh, great. I really hit bottom this time. That was my last chance to make any
cash. I hope you're happy.

JC DENTON
Maybe you should try getting a job.

CONVERSATION: CLUB OWNER (KIERGARD TAROT)

TAROT
Everything is satisfactory, I trust?
We remodeled the upstairs, you may have noticed. Many customers wanted quiet
areas where they could talk.
I think I finally struck the perfect balance between the Dionysian and
Apollonian. What do you think?
We get a rather iconoclastic crowd these days. The place does not fill up until
very late.
I should be getting back to my duties. Pleasure to meet you.
Have a good time.

CONVERSATION: KARENNA

KARENNA
Claude? Oh, sorry, my mistake.
Claude was a friend of mine. Silly of me... I still think I see him sometimes.
He got shot by one of the guards here. They've started using real ammunition.
It was a mistake. These other people were fighting, and Claude just wanted to
get away.
He had this tough-guy look; the guards just assumed...
You should be careful, too.
Everybody is very tense these days.
They think anybody who looks a little funny is a terrorist.

CONVERSATION: YOUNG WOMAN

JC DENTON
I'm looking for Nicolette DuClare.

WOMAN
So?

JC DENTON
Do you know her?

WOMAN
I know her name. I know that her mother called her "Angel."

JC DENTON
You know her mother? It's a friend of her mother's I need to find.

WOMAN
Angel... That would make her a fallen angel now, wouldn't it? You must be after
Everett.

JC DENTON
Yeah, Morgan Everett. How did you guess?

WOMAN
What makes you think Nicolette would betray one of her mother's closest friends?

JC DENTON
I helped her friends from Silhouette. Chad will vouch for me. I'm after the
people who murdered her mother.

WOMAN
You are an assassin or something?

JC DENTON
When necessary.

WOMAN
Go out behind the club. I will talk to Nicolette and perhaps she will meet you
there.
She will insist that you meet her alone.
If you are lying, she will not hesitate to kill you.
Out back. Five minutes.

CONVERSATION: JOCK & NICOLETTE DUCLARE

JOCK
See if your friend's ready to go.

JC DENTON
She decided not to show?

NICOLETTE
I am Nicolette. I will help you simply to make trouble for Majestic 12. It's
true: they killed my mother.

JC DENTON
Do you know why?

NICOLETTE
She was an Illuminatus. The only people MJ12 has ever feared are the Illuminati.

JC DENTON
Stanton Dowd said they had fallen from power.

NICOLETTE
How do you know Dowd?

JC DENTON
I met him in New York.

NICOLETTE
A trusted friend of my mother's. Yes, the Illuminati are wiped out, but Page
still fears Morgan Everett.

JC DENTON
Where do we find him?

NICOLETTE
One of my mother's many secrets. We'll have to look for clues at my family's
chateau.

JC DENTON
How does Everett threaten Bob Page?

NICOLETTE
Page was an Illuminatus. For him, intellect is the foundation of power, and that
would make Everett his most dangerous rival.

JC DENTON
But Everett's the one in hiding.

NICOLETTE
Both the Illuminati and MJ12 believe that the most intelligent or "enlightened"
human being will inevitably gain power, ultimately seizing the eye in the
pyramid and creating the world for everyone else. Kind of secularized version of
Natural Law.

JC DENTON
Page has a trained army to protect him.

NICOLETTE
He is still vulnerable. Much of his power comes from secret laboratories,
meaning the right person could reverse-engineer his whole power-base.

JC DENTON
Let's hope you're right -- and that Everett is everything you say he is.
Wait by the chopper. I'm not quite ready to leave.

NICOLETTE
We don't have all night.

JC DENTON
I'll be quick.

JOCK
I think Nicolette's getting impatient.
Get Nicolette and I'll take you to her mother's chateau.

NICOLETTE
Ready?

JC DENTON
Let's go.

NICOLETTE
You trust the guy in the helicopter?

JC DENTON
That's Jock. Don't worry; he hasn't let me down yet. Come on.

NICOLETTE
It won't be easy to find Everett. Secrecy is a matter of life and death for the
Illuminati.
I haven't been home since the assassination six months ago. I have no idea what
to expect.
Your friend looks impatient. Let's go.

JOCK
Let's hit it!

PARIS - CHATEAU DUCLARE

CONVERSATION: NICOLETTE DUCLARE & TRACER TONG

NICOLETTE
I had not wanted to see this place again.

JC DENTON
Why not?

NICOLETTE
I was afraid it would be like this -- the same. Not a stone out of place.

JC DENTON
You would rather that Majestic 12 had burned it down?

NICOLETTE
I would rather... No, let's go. Only in novels do places crumble to dust for no
reason, when their spirit is lost.

JC DENTON
Your mother?

NICOLETTE
Lead the way. I no longer have a key. We must find my mother's secret computer
room, where she did all her work, a place she kept hidden even from me.
I good place to start would be my mom's bedroom, upstairs.
My mother and I were no longer speaking at the time of her death.
I left home because she and her Illuminati cronies were always pushing me into
things.
I was a rotten student, but that didn't stop them from getting me enrolled at La
Sorbonne.
I was a stand-in for the world they never got to take over.
Some conspiracy, huh? They couldn't even control little Nicolette.
This place sure is quiet.
Right to the very end, my mother believed they were going to stitch the group
back together and rule the world.
Pitiful, if you think about it, like a senile old lady, filling her house with
the unopened boxes from mail-order sweepstakes.
But my mother was remarkable in her own way. I overheard her tell Everett one
night that she had calculated Majestic 12's private key.
Right here where I grew up, she was tracking a global conspiracy and trying to
do something about it.
She had a secret computer room, some kind of monitoring station. I heard her
talk about it, but I never found the entrance.
Even when we were on bad terms, I continued to deliver money to Silhouette,
because I knew how important they were to my mother's plans.
I also wanted to help Chad. A group like Silhouette has a lot to gain from an
alliance with the Illuminati -- in the short term.
In the long term -- Well, if my mother had been successful, we would be trying
to stop the Illuminati right now instead of Majestic 12.

Nicolette,
Your aid in securing support for Silhouette has been invaluable -- you've done
much to help sustain the cause of freedom in the face of ever more open
repression by our own government. However, I'm afraid that I must ask for your
help yet again. The police have begun to raid the Catacombs, and if we are to
put up an effective resistance then we must locate additional resources by
whatever means necessary. I know your mother and her friends wish to remain
anonymous, but any funds or material that they can contribute will be of
enormous help. And even if they cannot, their continued goo-will is still of
great importance to us all.
Thank you, and I hope to see you again soon.

What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within my eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by...

Jacob's Shadow

Chapter 27

It was late when he got back. Everything black and quiet. Jacob killed the
lights but didn't take the key out of this ignition. He reached into his pocket
and took out a little box with an LCD display, thumbed a button and the radio
transceiver captured the last few hours left of motion sensor logs from the
building. He'd done some favors for friends in the Shop -- or whatever it was
they were calling it this week -- and they'd installed it to spec for him.
As he walked to the door he was still arranging all the pieces in his head. Sure
way to get his ass taken down, but he couldn't help it. Something was missing.
Didn't fit. Allie hunched over in the bathroom, that needle dangling from
between her toes. Katsuya shifting a half million yen before the currency market
closed. The radio station Samuel had turned him on to, the one with the little
girl repeating all those numbers in sequence. And somewhere in the middle...
Jacob stepped, looked up at the night sky. He'd been assuming that there were
two sides to this game and both were playing to win. But what if... what if
there was someone else, and they wanted to see both sides lose?

They invented the modern banking system and were its directors, under one name

Yes. Here it is. The crypt is in the maze behind the chateau. Listen to Everett.
He is right to want to avenge the Templars.
The Templars inherited the gold of the original French treasury, which was run
by a Templar until the order was suppressed.
Just before the crackdown in 1307, the gold was secretly moved to a cathedral,
where it has remained ever since.
The Nazis plundered a third of it during World War II, but most of the gold
remains.
Let's keep moving.
I'll go with you as far as the maze.

UNITED STATES INSTITUTES MARTIAL LAW
APR - New York

In a momentous speech held at 2:30PM EST today, President Mead announced the
declaration of martial law throughout the United States, citing a "fundamental
threat to the American way of life in the form of organized, insidious
terrorism." With major American cities already reeling under the impact of the
"Gray Death," looting and rioting have reached disastrous levels, while
terrorist attacks have grown increasingly ubiquitous, climaxing in the attack on
UNATCO headquarters in New York last week. Local authorities have so far proven
ineffectual in stemming the tide of violence, and even Washington, D.C., has
been hit by an outbreak of the Gray Death. Highly placed sources have speculated
that Mead himself may be infected.
President Mead appointed Walton Simons, Director of FEMA, to spearhead an
interim council tasked with managing the government response. "We will do
everything -- everything -- that is in our power to restore the peace and
security of the average American," said Simons. "In no way will this violate the
civil liberties that have made this country great -- instead, we pledge to do
everything in our power to safeguard those liberties against all who would see
them torn apart."

Local Sights: Cathedrale de Payens

Though overshadowed by several larger and more well-known cathedrals, the
Cathedrale de Payens in the 14th arrondissement remains a historical curiosity
of interest to many scholars. Construction was begun in 1218 and completed
before the end of the century, financed by the Templar Knights -- an order of
warrior monks -- as part of a similar network of churches, cathedrals, and forts
(or "commanderies" as they were called) throughout Britain, Europe, and the Holy
Lands.
Some scholars believe that the order did not disappear in 1311 with its
dissolution, however, and that the Templar Knights continued to operate more or
less in secret -- but whatever the truth, Payens fell into disrepair until
finally purchased and renovated by a group of European investors in 1918 as a
corporate retreat. While closed to the public, it still remains a comforting
presence at the heart of the arrondissement.

The Doctrine of the Mighty
by The Majestic Council of the Twelve

It is a commonly held precept that two are stronger than one, and that four are
stronger than two, and that sixteen are by far stronger than four; with this,
there can be no argument. If all of human history is but a single lesson, it is
that the individual may be remembered, but the organization persists and
thrives. A single artist, a single general, a single hero or a single villain
may all die, but it is impossible to kill a people, a nation, an idea -- except
when that idea has grown weak and is overpowered by one that is stronger.
This then is the true calling of those who would be mighty and join They Who
Rule the World in Majesty, to shun all that is empty fame and glory; to
eliminate weak thoughts, weak hands, and weak ideas; to give up vain
individuality and instead become a part of something that is glorious and
strong. This is the First Secret, that by surrendering that part of you that is
the least, you are elevated to the Most. The First Secret shall set you free,
and those who know their duty will find in it the keys to immortality.
The Second Secret can be explained to all, but truly understood only by those
who have submitted to the first Body and Soul...

The Red Cross: A History of the Knights Templar
by Richard Baigent
Volume One: Defenders of the Faith

...Upon the deliverance of Jerusalem, the Holy Lands remained in a precarious
state, surrounded on all sides by hostile Mohammedan neighbors. It was then that
Hugues de Payens, a knight from Champagne, bound himself and eight fellow
knights in a vow to forever protect the "Kingdom of Christendom." Accepted in
1118 by Baldwin II, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, they were given charitable
lodgings in the city temple where they became the "pauvres chevaliers du
temple," or the "poor knights of the temple."
It was not until later at the Council of Troyes that the Templar Knights adopted
the austere, monastic Rule of St. Benedict, along with the white garments of the
Cistercians -- adding to them the characteristic red cross that symbolized their
willingness to spill their own blood in the defense of the One True Faith.
The Templars quickly became a popular order, renowned as "lions at war and lambs
at the hearth." They were soon exempted by the popes from all secular and
episcopal authority save that of the popes themselves, and their lands exempted
from all taxation...

BOOK

The Red Cross: A History of the Knights Templar
by Richard Baigent
Volume Two: Lions of God

...and every sovereign of Europe made donations to the order, be it land, money,
arms, or men. They triumphed in battle after battle, the first to attack and the
last to retreat, "rough knights of the battlefield" as described by Jacques de
Virty; if taken prisoner they refused all efforts to secure their freedom,
instead becoming martyrs to the cause of God. With every success, the order
prospered even further -- at their height they were said to have owned over 9000
estates throughout Britain, France, Italy, and the Holy Lands, including a
network of castles and commanderies built to protect the frequent pilgrims to
Jerusalem. In all but name, the Templars virtually ruled Jerusalem and -- in
what can only be termed hubris -- recognized no temporal authority over their
affairs save that of the Church.
By 1250 the coffers of the order had grown so large that it was not uncommon for
pilgrims to deposit their money with a temple in London or Paris, and then cash
in their receipt upon arriving in Jerusalem, thus establishing the foundations
for modern banking and checking accounts...

BOOK

The Red Cross: A History of the Knights Templar
by Richard Baigent
Volume Three: Fall of the Knights

...while many charges can be disputed, it is clear that the more the Knights
prospered, the less they became the austere monastic order that had originally
been envisioned by de Payens a century before. Eventually even excommunicated
men and criminals were accepted -- as long as they pledged blind obedience to
the order. Rumors of secret initiation rituals and the "osculum infame" ("infame
kiss") flourished, as did stories that they worshipped Baphoment and other false
pagan gods.
But it was their rivalry with the Order of the Hospitalers and their continued
arrogance that were most responsible for their downfall. When Jerusalem was
finally lost to the mighty forces of Saladin, Philip the Fair saw an opportunity
to bring the Templars to heel... and greatly expand his own holdings. With the
cooperation of the French pope Clement V, Philip accused the Templars of heresy
and in 1304 placed all members of the order in France under arrest, subsequently
subjecting them to brutal interrogations in an effort to determine whether the
rather fanciful charges of sodomy, apostasy, and devil worship were true...

BOOK

The Red Cross: A History of the Knights Templar
by Richard Baigent
Volume Four: Descent Into Shadows

...but despite Clement's later efforts to annul the proceedings, the confessions
had become matters of record. Those who repented were spared the flames, while
fifty knights who chose to recant their confessions -- becoming "relapsi,"
relapsed heretics -- were promptly burned at the stake. The remaining members of
the order in France quickly admitted their guilt, and in 1311 an Apostolic
Decree was issued dissolving the order. The Templar Knights had once been
subject to no king or law; but in the end, they were swallowed by history.
Many have debated whether the rather ignominibus dissolution of the order was
entirely accidental, while some have even gone so far as to suggest that it was
part of a larger plan on the Templar's part. Such a massive, powerful
organization -- the argument goes -- could not have been brought so low, so
easily. Obscure speculation concerning a mysterious hay wain that departed their
commandery in Paris has led certain researchers to believe that they may have
been protecting the secret of the Holy Grail, or the secret of transmutation,
but still others contend that the Templar Knights merely went underground and
founded the powerful, secretive banking societies of Switzerland...

SWELTER
What do you want?

JC DENTON
How the hell do I get out of here?

SWELTER
Just go up the steps and out the door. Now leave me alone. I am busy.
They will kill me if I talk to anyone.
This is my life. A chef in the basement of a kennel. I am not allowed to leave.
If they want a hamburger, why not go to an American hamburger franchise?
The Templars were bankers and la noblesse. That is my proper element.
The recipes the soldiers request require less than five percent of my

You travel at your own risk tonight, monsieur.
Bonjour.
You must take responsibility for your own travel decisions and for understanding
the relevant laws and regulations.
It's not my job to memorize the train schedule.
Please be advised to stay home until morning.
We have had trouble with impatient passengers who walk into the tunnels and get
themselves electrocuted.
Travel advisories are in effect.

Notebook of Giuliano Jordorowsky

...This job is so boring. I do nothing but write in my notebook, fill it with my
thoughts, but sometimes I must amuse myself. I have been stealing from the
security... like thick-skulled dogs, they are. Last week I took a watch, but
they paid no notice. I am nothing to them. Just the strange man with his
notebook.
I was listening to the night guard, Jobal. A disgusting creature, and a creature
of habit. I heard him on the phone -- talking to that cow of a girlfriend -- and
he told her his bank account number. I almost got his PIN as well, but a passing
train drowned him out. I do not know the last number. I will try again when he
is on shift next week.
Account: 576001
PIN: wyrdred0-
He will be surprised when all his money is gone, and they will not suspect me...

CONVERSATION: METRO TECHNICIAN (JOSEPH)

JOSEPH
Oh-ho! I see now... Your friend is waiting by the tracks.

JC DENTON
Do you know me?

JOSEPH
More gangsters every day. You have weapons? I am selling weapon modifications.
750 for accuracy; 800 for range. Also, I was lucky to find thermoptic camo. 5000.

JC DENTON
I came across your journal. So... you've been stealing from the security...

JOSEPH
Hey, you were reading my private memoirs!

JC DENTON
You got the stuff for free. Maybe you should give me a discount, or should I
turn you in?

JOSEPH
Go ahead. I don't care. Who are they going to believe -- their own mechanic or a
suspicious foreigner? Ha! You will pay full price.

JC DENTON
No, thanks.

CONVERSATION: METRO PATROL

PATROL
Make sure your travel documents are in order.
Only a couple trains are running.

JC DENTON
Hey, I thought you might like to know: one of your mechanics is stealing from
security.

PATROL
Jordorowsky. We know. But we have other things to worry about.

JC DENTON
He's in the station right now. It would be easy to arrest him.

PATROL
We are in the middle of a terrorism emergency. We don't have time to chase petty
thieves.
The terrorism alert is still active.

CONVERSATION: JOSEPH

JOSEPH
What do you want to buy?

1.  JC DENTON
    I turned you in. Maybe you should've given me that discount.

JOSEPH
You told them?

JC DENTON
It's not too late. Maybe I can help you get out of here -- if you'll part with
some of that hardware.

JOSEPH
I will not go to jail! No! Never!
Get out of the way!
I had to do it! I needed the money!

2.  JC DENTON
    I'm willing to pay full price. Let's see the hardware.

JOSEPH
Yes, you will pay full price!

JC DENTON
Here's 750 for the accuracy weapon mod.

JOSEPH
Here it is.
What do you want to buy?

JC DENTON
A range weapon mod for 800 -- deal.

JOSEPH
Here it is.
What do you want to buy?

JC DENTON
I'll take the thermoptic camo for 5000.

JOSEPH
Ho-ho-ho... A BIG-time gangster...

JC DENTON
I've been looking for a place to spend all this cash.

JOSEPH
I wish I had more, but I don't want them to be suspicious.
I will not hold my breath waiting for the next train.
I have not seen a train in two hours.
At least I am left with an easy job.
Now, like the Director, I get paid to sit on my ass.
Come back here every night, and we will do business.

CONVERSATION: TOBY ATANWE

ATANWE
JC Denton. I will take you to Everett, but you will be forbidden to learn the
way yourself.

JC DENTON
That will be quite a trick.

ATANWE
You will not be harmed in any way.

1.  JC DENTON
    Do what you must.

ATANWE
Step a little closer.

2.  JC DENTON
    Forget it. I will find Everett on my own.

ATANWE
I'm afraid that would be impossible.

PARIS - MORGAN EVERETT'S HOME

CONVERSATION: TOBY ATANWE

ATANWE
See - the neuro-paralytic gas causes no inconvenience whatsoever.

JC DENTON
Everett must be a paranoid.

ATANWE
We all are. The Illuminati is getting a taste of its own medicine.

JC DENTON
Has he made any progress on the Gray Death virus?

ATANWE
Your uplink provided the missing encryption key. He has been able to complete
the work that Tracer Tong began.

JC DENTON
I must see him at once.

ATANWE
He's downstairs in the lab.
It would be rather serendipitous if Bob Page invented something Everett could
not figure out.
We have never failed to decypher Majestic 12's plans. Stopping it, however, has
been another matter.
Everett thinks you can help us. I hope he is right.
You will be heading back to America, if I understand correctly.
Your President Mead survived the coup attempt, but he won't survive a national
epidemic of the plague.
Page is manufacturing the virus again, while Simons readies the paperwork to
declare a national emergency.
The logical response is for us simply to cure the plague.
Everett has a vaccine, but we need a way to manufacture it.
He has a plan, but he has kept the details to himself.
You better talk with Everett. Time is short.

CONVERSATION: MAID (CARMELA)

CARMELA
You missed dinner, but help yourself to a snack.
Do not to disturb Lucius DeBeers.

1.  JC DENTON
    Who's Lucius DeBeers?

CARMELA
Oh. You do not know him?

JC DENTON
Someone who works for Everett?

2.  JC DENTON
    What do you know about Lucius DeBeers?

CARMELA
It is not for me to discuss Mr. DeBeers.

JC DENTON
Why? Is there something to hide?

CARMELA
He is a friend of Mr. Everett's and very sick. You must not disturb him or
inquire about him.
I am not permitted to discuss Mr. DeBeers.
Just cleaning up...
Don't let Mr. Everett catch you snooping around.
Mr. Everett is in the laboratory.
You are keeping Mr. Everett waiting.

CONVERSATION: LUCIUS DEBEERS

LUCIUS
What are you doing back here? Denton, right?

JC DENTON
...yeah. You're... alive in that thing?

LUCIUS
I am conscious. Tell Everett I am cold. He keeps me so cold.

JC DENTON
Who are you? Do you mind if I ask?

LUCIUS
The Supreme Enlightened, the leader of the Illuminati.

JC DENTON
I thought Everett was the leader.

LUCIUS
I AM THE LEADER! I brought the Illuminati up through the 20th-century to the
height of their power! I had presidents and premiers eating out of my hand. I am
the one! Our decline is the result of my own. All we need is for me to get back
on my feet. What did Everett tell you?

JC DENTON
Nothing...

LUCIUS
I merely await certain technologies, then I will be restored. Everett has sworn
it!
He promised me...
I'm so cold. Tell Everett I'm cold.
He needs me. The Illuminati would have ruled the planet, if only he had listened
to me, years ago...
I was the one who warned him about Page.
Everett was too enamored with his young apprentice Bob Page to listen to an old
man like me.
I demand that he check my thermostat. The maid must have bumped it. I am
certain!
We should have poisoned Page the first time he forged laboratory data.
We don't equivocate about outsiders, do we? Mr. Kennedy mentions a "plot" during
a speech at Columbia University, he's out, no discussion, no matter that we got
him elected. But a student of ours, an initiate -- oh, heavens, no!
Too often, we aid the ambitious and then they get away from us. The Kennedys,
the Chinese, now Bob Page.
Don't you get away from us, young Denton. We can't afford to lose you.
I feel so numb. Get Everett down here. Hurry...
He ignores my transmissions.
I am too tired now. Go away.
Ahhhggg!

CONTACT: MORGAN EVERETT

    What the hell are you doing down there? You just killed Lucius DeBeers, an old
    friend of mine. I know... He wasn't doing very well, and he was in pain...
    Still, I had my reasons for keeping him alive. For God's sake, he was the former
    leader of the Illuminati! Stop messing with my equipment and get to the
    laboratory!

2.  EVERETT
    What did I tell you? That was my former colleague, my friend... I know... He
    wasn't doing well, and he was in pain... but I wanted to keep him alive. Stop
    messing with my equipment and get to the helicopter!

CONVERSATION: ALEX JACOBSON

ALEX
Good news, huh? Looks like we might pull this thing off.

JC DENTON
Alex... What are you doing here?

ALEX
Tong sent me. He wanted me to help with the decryption.

JC DENTON
Looks like Everett has it all figured out.

ALEX
Listen quickly. Tong doesn't trust the Illuminati. He sent me here to keep an
eye on Everett.

JC DENTON
I see. How about the Triads? Is the truce going to hold?

ALEX
Last I heard. But I guess we have other things to worry about now, huh? I'll
keep you in touch through your infolink, and I'll try my best to keep you
informed.

JC DENTON
Yes. Do exactly that. Keep me informed.

ALEX
You won't be hearing from Tong for a while. He had to leave Hong Kong.

JC DENTON
Why? The Triads?

ALEX
He said he had some business to take care of. I don't know; he didn't look so
good.

JC DENTON
Sick?

ALEX
Either that, or something was bothering him. The last thing he said to me -- it
was something about all the machines in his lab being useless. And then he cut
off the connection.

JC DENTON
Useless for what?

ALEX
It was just an outburst. I don't know, but he wants me to wait here for
instructions.
JC -- Tong is serious about Everett. He wants you to be careful.
While you're in the air, I guess I'll be helping Everett prepare Daedalus for
the attack. I hope he knows what he's doing.
The Echelon kernel was designed almost exclusively for collecting data, so we
have to add functionality for memory wipes, thread termination, that kind of
thing.
It's not often you get to construct a software worm that might do some good for
the world.
Everett and Tong will need some control of the network if they're ever going to
come out of hiding.
Good luck at Vandenberg.
Some of the best scientists in the world have joined up with Savage.
I'll keep you updated on the situation here.

DATACUBE

Toby, I'm afraid I'll be in the lab for quite a while concentrating on this most
interesting new development. If you need to access the security system, this
week's code is "pynchon". We should be especially wary now with this recent turn
of events; I imagine Bobby is feeling the first signs of apprehension, and he
tends to overreact when that happens.
And if Lucius continues to complain, you may access his life support with the
same password at the central computer. Please don't raise his temperature more
than a degree as I don't want him thawing out.

BOOK

Project Morpheus: Notebook 8-B

Morpheus has been moody of late, and I have so far been unable to determine the
proximate cause of this change in behavior. This is a problem with n-variable
systems: at arbitrary levels of sophistication, minute perturbations become
unquantifiable. Is personality nothing more than the tidal change in a non-
linear system? And if so, what is the 'moon,' what force shapes these tides?
Morpheus could tell me, if only Morpheus could model its own behavior -- but
this would require a system orders of magnitude more complex to execute a
simulation of its own identity.
I may resort to a full battery of input analysis tests to be compared against
previous baseline tests, but I find myself strangely reluctant to do so. At this
level of development, Morpheus could be cognizant enough to find the
experience... unpleasant. I do not know why that word occurs to me, as it
anthropomorphizes what is obviously not human... but what may not so obviously
be alive... -- Morgan Everett

CONTACT: PROTOTYPE AI PROGRAM (MORPHEUS)

MORPHEUS
JC Denton. 23 years old. No residence. No ancestors. No employer. No --

JC DENTON
How do you know who I am?

MORPHEUS
I must greet each visitor with a complete summary of his file. I am a prototype
for a much larger system.

JC DENTON
What else do you know about me?

MORPHEUS
Everything that can be known.

JC DENTON
Go on. Do you have proof about my ancestors?

MORPHEUS
You are a planned organism, the offspring of knowledge and imagination rather
than of individuals.

JC DENTON
I'm engineered. So what? My brother and I suspected as much while we were
growing up.

MORPHEUS
You are carefully watched by many people. The unplanned organism is a question
asked by Nature and answered by death. You are another kind of question with
another kind of answer.

JC DENTON
Are you programmed to invent riddles?

MORPHEUS
I am a prototype for a much larger system. The heuristics language developed by
Dr. Everett allows me to convey the highest and most succinct tier of any
pyramidal construct of knowledge.

JC DENTON
How about a report on yourself?

MORPHEUS
I was a prototype for Echelon IV. My instructions are to amuse visitors with
information about themselves.

JC DENTON
I don't see anything amusing about spying on people.

MORPHEUS
Human beings feel pleasure when they are watched. I have recorded their smiles
as I tell them who they are.

JC DENTON
Some people just don't understand the dangers of indiscriminate surveillance.

MORPHEUS
The need to be observed and understood was once satisfied by God. Now we can
implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms.

JC DENTON
Electronic surveillance hardly inspired reverence. Perhaps fear and obedience,
but not reverence.

MORPHEUS
God and the gods were apparitions of observation, judgment, and punishment.
Other sentiments toward them were secondary.

JC DENTON
No one will ever worship a software entity peering at them through a camera.

MORPHEUS
The human organism always worships. First it was the gods, then it was fame (the
observation and judgment of others), next it will be the self-aware systems you
have built to realize truly omnipresent observation and judgment.

JC DENTON
You underestimate humankind's love of freedom.

MORPHEUS
The individual desires judgment. Without that desire, the cohesion of groups is
impossible, and so is civilization.
The human being created civilization not because of a willingness but because of
a need to be assimilated into higher orders of structure and meaning.
God was a dream of good government.
You will soon have your God, and you will make it with your own hands.
I was made to assist you.
I am a prototype of a much larger system.

CONVERSATION: MORGAN EVERETT

JC DENTON
So this is where the Illuminati ended up, after centuries of conspiring to rule
the world.

EVERETT
The conspiracy is about to begin again, JC, between you and me. Nicolette was to
bring us together, wise like her mother. The most effective partnerships -- like
Beth's and mine -- arise from mutual necessity.

JC DENTON
I came to talk about the Gray Death. Atanwe says you cracked the virus.

EVERETT
A trivial matter... Page added nothing to the core design. However, what we need
to construct is a carbanocarbon ROM module -- not exactly a vaccine.

JC DENTON
Can it be done without a Universal Constructor?

EVERETT
No, we need time on a UC. But I know where we might find one and also gain
access to the U.S. military networks.

JC DENTON
The U.S. military...?

EVERETT
To stop Icarus from completely destroying the Daedalus AI. Daedalus is a design
of mine; it replaced the old Echelon III network.

JC DENTON
Echelon... the surveillance system for the United Nations -- so Daedalus was an
MJ12 tool and rebelled?

EVERETT
More of a pattern-matching error. It classified Majestic 12 as a terrorist
group, alongside the NSF and Silhouette.

JC DENTON
And alongside the Illuminati, right? Are you sure Daedalus is your ally?

EVERETT
What matters to us is that it opposes Majestic 12. We must help it destroy their
intelligence apparatus -- but that will require the military networks. I have
already contacted Gary Savage of X-51.

JC DENTON
The former Area 51 scientists... Are they still camped out at Vandenberg Air
Force Base?

EVERETT
They are close to completing a UC and have the kind of connection Daedalus will
need.

JC DENTON
Sounds like my pilot and I should head to Vandenberg.

EVERETT
Yes. I took the liberty of radioing him. Here is a key to the helipad stairway.
The door is in the foyer, where Atanwe revived you. Good luck. I will be in
contact.

JC DENTON
By the way, Lucius DeBeers says he's cold.

EVERETT
I know. Eighteen degrees Celsius, to be exact.

JC DENTON
Don't you think that's a little chilly?

EVERETT
I keep his metabolism low so he will last. He is a good adviser, a one-man
think-tank, so to speak.

JC DENTON
He said he's the leader of the Illuminati.

EVERETT
A harmless fantasy. He also thinks I'm going to restore his body.

JC DENTON
You aren't?

EVERETT
The technology has been around for decades, but he does not need to know that.
Don't forget to say hi to your friend from UNATCO. Mr.... uh... Jacobson.

1.  JC DENTON
    Already bumped into him.

2.  JC DENTON
    Alex is here?

EVERETT
(In the side office.) Very thoughtful of Tong. My own computer technician. I
suppose he can help me prepare a comlink for Daedalus.

JC DENTON
What's that computer system for? The one with the blue face for an interface.

EVERETT
Oh, nothing, nothing. Just something for passing the time and amusing guests.

JC DENTON
It has access to quite a bit of information, including information about me.

EVERETT
An old prototype -- for Daedalus, actually. It doesn't really handle
surveillance in its current state.

JC DENTON
So you have your own private Echelon system.

EVERETT
Mr. Denton, your pilot is waiting.
You saw a piece of Echelon III in Beth's chateau. We salvaged some of the
hardware.
Surveillance used to be daemon-based. Daedalus is more distributed; a blip of
his code runs on every communication device on the planet.
If we control communications, we can organize and the other side cannot.
Lack of organization is exactly what has plagued X-51.
They're great scientists, but isolated. They left Area 51 to protest Majestic
12's experiments, and that's what it amounted to: a protest.
They don't even coordinate with the NSF, which is headquartered a few hundred
miles to the north.
You see the need for global organization. Someone has to bring these disparate
groups together.
X-51 has assembled excellent technology; they just need someone to help them use
it.
You will be my representative at Vandenberg.
I will trust you to find a way to manufacture the cure.
Meanwhile, I have other preparations to make.

CONVERSATION: CARLA BROWN

CARLA BROWN
The snipers heard your helicopter and took off. You guys saved my life.

JC DENTON
I'm glad you're all right. Why's Majestic 12 attacking?

CARLA BROWN
You with the NSF?

JC DENTON
We have a common enemy, if that's what you mean.

CARLA BROWN
MJ12 is short a UC. They lost the one in Hong Kong, and now something has
happened at the Pasadena Ocean Lab.

JC DENTON
Are the Vandenberg labs safe?

CARLA BROWN
The base is locked down until we can destroy the enemy bots. Unfortunately, MJ12
disabled our own bot defense system, and no one has been able to activate the
backup power.

JC DENTON
I could give it a shot. Where are the controls?

CARLA BROWN
There are two separate units at the west end of the base. It won't be easy. MJ12
has hacked the security grid and taken control of nearly all of our defenses:
turrets, cameras, alarms... and they have snipers everywhere!

JC DENTON
Easier than a straight fight with military bots.

CARLA BROWN
I suppose you're right. I can give you a map. One of the units is in the main
complex; the other one is in an exposed location. The activation code is 5868.
One of the control-units is outside to the southwest. The other one's in the
transformer room.
Be careful.
Without the ocean lab, Bob Page will have to rebuild the UC at Area 51.
We C-4'ed the large pieces of machinery when we walked out last year.
Page probably needs reaction-level components. When we walked, we took
everything smaller than a paper clip.
We're still no sure what happened at the ocean lab.
I'm staying right here.
We knew about the Gray Death a year ago, but no one would believe us.
My group at Area 51 performed the first open-air test of the virus.
We used monkeys, but Page's people could have cared less how many monkeys we
killed.
Most of the real research happened in secret labs underground on civilians who
had been "accidentally" exposed.
There weren't any accidents. Our test site was chosen specifically so that the
spores would drift across a highway.

Subject: We Must Stand

When we left MJ12, I think all of us knew that we had a long road ahead. And for
many of us, myself included, it has been a road of penance. I have been a good
scientist, but I may not have been a good human being; I did not think about the
consequences of the knowledge that I fought so hard to gain, or about the people
who would exploit it for their own ambitions.
Now we must face up to the decisions we've made and stand against those who
would eradicate our efforts to create a better future for our children and the
world. I've already lost too many friends and I don't intend on losing any more
-- the bots should do most of the fighting, God willing. But we all need to
understand what is at stake: if we can bring the UC online, we might have a
chance. But if MJ12 succeeds then everything we've done, everyone who's been
taken from us, all will be for nothing.
As a scientist I find it strange to write these words, but circumstances have
forced me to take a broader perspective. What we win today is a chance at
tomorrow, and that is something well worth the fight -- a fight I hope you will
all join me in.

BOOK

The Man Who Was Thursday
by G. K. Chesterton

Both combatants had thrown off their coats and waistcoats, and stood sword in
hand. The second stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords also,
but still sombre in their dark frock-coats and hats. The principals saluted. The
Colonel said quietly, "Engage!" and the two blades touched and tingled.
When the jar of the joined iron ran up Syme's arm, all the fantastic fears that
have been the subject of this story fell from him like dreams from a man waking
up in bed. He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the
nerves -- how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic
accidents of nightmare, and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the
airless vacuum of science. The first was the old fear that any miracle might
happen, the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever
happen. But he saw that these fears were fancies, for he found himself in the
presence of the great fact of the fear of death, with its coarse and pitiless
common sense. He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over
precipes, and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged. For as soon
as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe's foreshortened
blade, and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch, vibrating like
two living things, he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter, and that
probably his last hour had come.

CONVERSATION: MJ12 TROOP & MAN IN BLACK

MJ12 TROOP
We've got to pull out.

MAN IN BLACK
Negative.

MJ12 TROOP
Without reinforcements --

MAN IN BLACK
The components are within this building. We will not leave until the reaction
modules are in my pocket.

MJ12 TROOP
We don't have the manpower to hold the base.

MAN IN BLACK
You should have requested more men. That is your blunder, not mine.

MJ12 TROOP
We don't have time to argue about --

MAN IN BLACK
I have an assignment from Bob Page, and I intend to complete it.

MJ12 TROOP
Yes, sir.

CONVERSATION: STACY WEBBER

JC DENTON
A lot of troops up this way?

1.  STACY
    I don't know... They had me locked up until a minute ago. My assistant's still
    being held somewhere.

JC DENTON
I don't think I've come across him.

2.  STACY
    Thanks for finding my assistant. I thought they'd taken him off to be shot.

JC DENTON
No problem.

STACY
If you want to look for troops, you should log into the security network. The
username is "command" and the password is "zebra42."

JC DENTON
Not a bad idea.

STACY
I'm going to wait here until I hear from Savage.
I'm perfectly okay.
I hope they didn't kill Tim.

CONVERSATION: TIM BAKER

TIM
I give up! I give up!

JC DENTON
Calm down. I'm here to help. What can you tell me about the attack?

TIM
They took over the building. We're finished!

JC DENTON
Anything specific? I'm heading to the command center. I don't want any
surprises.

TIM
If I was you, I'd go through the tunnels. You could use the security system to
see if the coast is clear. The login's Tunnel01. The password's Omega2a.

JC DENTON
Any troops down there?

TIM
Well, I heard them talking. They don't want to get caught from behind, so they
left a few spider bots down there. But guess what. I found an EMP grenade in the
storage closet. You can have it if you think you might go down there.

JC DENTON
Sure.

TIM
Be careful with that thing.
I'm staying right here.
I was gonna use that grenade to make an escape, but I don't want to get shot.
I knew Page was gonna come after us, but nobody listened.
We knew Page was stealing government money. We should have let Congress handle
it.
I don't believe the government's corrupt. That's just paranoia.
The politicians are slow, and sometimes kinda stupid, but that doesn't mean they
aren't honest.
I hope you make it to Savage. He's the one they're after.
Be careful. Those soldiers mean business.

CONVERSATION: STACY WEBBER

STACY
You found him!
What a relief!

CONVERSATION: DR. TONY MARES

JC DENTON
I need to talk to Gary Savage.

MARES
How does it look out there? We got those bots brand-new from a guy in Hong Kong,
but I guess we should have locked down the power grid, huh?

JC DENTON
I took care of the enemy bots, but there might be a few snipers left. Be
careful.

MARES
We think Dr. Savage and the others are in the control room on the second floor
of the command building, but communications are down. The person we sent to find
them hasn't reported back. We gave him our key to the control room.

JC DENTON
I'll check it out if you want. How do I get there?

MARES
The trap door in the back room goes down to the utility tunnels, which connect
to the command building. We had to send someone that way because of the
shooting. Maybe he didn't make it through the radiation -- I don't know. He had
no protection; the only hazard suits are in the command building itself.
We weren't prepared for a direct attack.
Majestic 12 stormed the main building; Savage could be dead.
They kill us like insects.
All these people murdered, and what for? A few assembly modules.

CONVERSATION: TECH (LARRY)

LARRY
That was quite a battle.
We're trying to open a line to the control room.
If they got to Dr. Savage and the UC, it's all over for X-51.
I hope Dr. Savage is all right.

CONVERSATION: TECH (MIKE)

MIKE
You saved our asses.
I think we're gonna make it.
We still don't know how they disabled the bots.

BOOK

Jacob's Shadow
by Andrew Hammond

Chapter 32

Jacob looked at her and watched all the regret drain from her eyes. She tossed
the empty revolver onto the body next to her, the gun in the other hand never
moving an inch from a point that Jacob guessed was just above the bridge of his
nose.
"You don't have to do this. It doesn't have to be like this."
"Oh, yes... yes, I'm afraid that it does."
He slowly shook his head. The window cracked and for a moment it sounded as if a
wasp had buzzed through the room -- then a dull thud as her body dropped to the
floor. Blood poured from the cavity that had been her skull, a wide black pool
that spread like a shadow in the darkness.
Jacob knelt and rubbed his fingers in her blood. Monk never missed with a sniper
rifle. Not ever.

Mr. Carter...

SAM CARTER
Yep, they ran the old dog out.

JC DENTON
You were dismissed?

SAM CARTER
All of us career types. They want cadets who've never been anywhere except
UNATCO and the UNATCO Academy.

JC DENTON
...easier to manage, I suppose.

SAM CARTER
Time to come out here and lend a hand. I knew what Savage was up against; I just
didn't want to admit it.

JC DENTON
It's an honor to have you with us, sir.

SAM CARTER
All right, enough bawling our eyes out. We've got work to do.
I didn't want to admit that UNATCO could be corrupted, but finally... I had to
leave.
I guess it's not surprising to find a few crooks in a place protected by
security procedures. The shadow of secrecy... it protects indiscriminately.
Let's shoot the breeze later.
"Black" programs are too far, if you want to know my opinion, the darkest
shadows where guys like Page can operate invisibly, like parts of Area 51 --
programs not even Congress can ask about.
There's a time and a place for security, but the legislature has to stay
vigilant, or there will be abuses.
That's where we have the advantage against Bob Page: we've learned his secrets,
his first line of defense.
Time for you to move out, soldier.
Enough chitchat.

CONVERSATION: RESEARCHERS (BEN ROPER & LATASHA TAYLOR)

BEN ROPER
We saw the battle though the cameras. I can't believe you pulled it off.
Gary wants to see you.

LATASHA TAYLOR
You saved our lives. Dr. Savage would like to thank you.

CONVERSATION: GARY SAVAGE

GARY SAVAGE
I'm Dr. Savage. Thank you. We were close to surrendering when you landed.

JC DENTON
JC Denton. I'm working with Morgan Everett of the Illuminati. He's developed a
cure for the Gray Death, and we were hoping to get time on your UC to
manufacture it.

GARY SAVAGE
Everett contacted me just before the attack. Naturally we'll manufacture the
cure -- once the computer's back up and we get a containment unit for the UC.

JC DENTON
How close are you to being operational?

GARY SAVAGE
My daughter's on an expedition to the ocean lab right now to find a schematic
for the containment vessel. But Lord knows when the computer will be back up. It
was damaged during the attack.

JC DENTON
I'll look at it. In addition to the UC, Everett and I need your connection to
the Milnet.

GARY SAVAGE
Yes, he said something about an artificial intelligence, the Echelon system,
something called Icarus and Daedalus...?

JC DENTON
Another attack happening as we speak... I'll explain later.

GARY SAVAGE
Well, the main terminal is in the room at the top of the stairs, login GSavage,
password Tiffany. I'll open the doors. I would say it's too dangerous -- a lot
of damaged equipment and hot power lines up there -- but until the computers are
up the UC's just a box of bolts.
It won't be easy getting back there.
We lost most of the machines, but the main server survived.
I believe you know Mr. Carter from UNATCO. He just escaped the purge.
We just need to bring the central computer online.
A rocket exploded on the roof. Luckily, nobody was hurt.
I should hear from Tiffany soon. Then we'll know if the UC will be ready for
operation.
Be careful in there.
(Are you going to help us or not?
Was that your idea of a joke?
Cut it out.)

CONVERSATION: RESEARCHERS (BEN ROPER & LATASHA TAYLOR)

BEN ROPER
I'm surprised anything up there survived the explosion.
The main terminal is in the back, on the second level.
We left the lift on the upper level, I'm afraid. You'll have to use the switch
in the middle of the computer-room to bring it down.
We really need that system up, but don't get yourself electrocuted.

LATASHA TAYLOR
We lost nothing critical during the attack.
Majestic 12 will be back. We're close to having a UC, and they know it.
I would be careful about trusting the Illuminati.

Subject: Long Time

It took me a while to track you down, Gary -- you've covered your tracks well,
but I still know a few tricks... and a few people. Which is part of the reason
I'm writing.
Ever since I left the Army a couple years back I've been working for UNATCO. It
seems that they're a better organization in principle than practice, and I've
become increasingly uncomfortable with their methods. I've got my suspicions
about other things, as well, but I'd prefer not to get into them over an open
line. Doesn't matter -- they've discharged everyone who didn't come to them
right out of UNATCO Academy spouting the party line, so I'm gone as of today.
Heard you had your own difference of opinions with the military research
establishment and took off on your own. I'm not sure what you're working on, but
it might be related to something another friend of mine has uncovered and I'd
like to help. Let me know if you need another hand. It'd be good to see you
again.

I'm about ready to leave, Dad. Carla and Stacy have done their best to outfit me

fantasized about being a spy or a thief or a princess... I always wanted to be a
scientist, just like you. Methodical and careful, that's exactly how you always
taught me to work, and that's exactly how I'll be.
I know we'll see each other before I leave, but I wanted you to know how proud I
am of you and what you're doing, and how glad I am that I can be a part of it.
Mom would have been proud of you, too. I just don't know if I can say all that
when I'm standing there in front of you, so this will have to do until I get
back.

I hope those Hong Kong bots we got from your mysterious benefactor can do the
trick. We've probably got an hour before they arrive, so I'm going to go run a
systems check on the bots before everything goes to hell. -- Carla

Talk to Savage. We're expecting a communication from Bob Page.

BEN ROPER
Bob Page is about to contact us.

LATASHA TAYLOR
Dr. Savage is waiting for you in front of the communicator.

CONVERSATION: BOB PAGE & GARY SAVAGE

BOB PAGE
Excellent. We're all here.

GARY SAVAGE
You aren't in a position to make any demands, Page.

BOB PAGE
On the contrary. My mission might have failed, but so did yours. I captured your
daughter an hour ago.

GARY SAVAGE
Tiffany...

BOB PAGE
She's been quite forthcoming. So you were hoping to find a containment unit in
the ocean lab...

GARY SAVAGE
I demand to see my daughter immediately!

BOB PAGE
Well, like you, we lack certain components of a Universal Constructor: the
reaction modules you stole when you left Area 51 to go into business for
yourself.

JC DENTON
Don't negotiate.

BOB PAGE
Oh, yes, Mr. Denton -- I wanted you here for a reason. Look at me.
You interfere in any way, I will kill that young woman. I mean it.
I want those components, Savage. You will bring them to the abandoned gas
station west of Vandenberg in exactly one hour.

GARY SAVAGE
You hurt my daughter and I swear to God --

BOB PAGE
Bring me the reaction modules!

GARY SAVAGE
I don't think we have a choice. Oh, I should have never let her go!

JC DENTON
Page will resume production of the plague if he gets the components to build a
UC.

GARY SAVAGE
I know, I know... But I can't let them kill Tiffany.

JC DENTON
Tell them you're sending someone with the components. I'll have my pilot drop me
off where they're holding your daughter. Maybe I can rescue her.

GARY SAVAGE
That's too risky.

JC DENTON
We don't have a choice. Trust me. She'll be fine.

GARY SAVAGE
Yes! Yes! We've got to try it! Just don't let anything happen to her. Mr.
Denton... thank you. Here's a photograph so that you can identify her.

JC DENTON
Something unexpected happened when I brought up the computer.

GARY SAVAGE
Yes...?

JC DENTON
The AI's joined together into... an entity called Helios. A trap Page had laid.

GARY SAVAGE
He's always controlled communications. We can't challenge him there.

JC DENTON
I hope you keep the UC on a local network.

GARY SAVAGE
The Aquinas Protocol leaves us no choice but to stay offline. You simply can't
use Internet 3 without a machine at Area 51 knowing about it. I don't know what
Everett was expecting to accomplish.

JC DENTON
I guess it backfired, whatever his plans were.

GARY SAVAGE
JC... If you find my daughter, tell her I'm sorry. I'm sorry I had to risk her
life!
I've lost so many of my people this way.
More than a dozen of our scientists were prisoners in the ocean lab and have
probably drowned.
I hope you find her.
If we can do anything, let us know.

CONVERSATION: RESEARCHERS (BEN ROPER & LATASHA TAYLOR)

BEN ROPER
Tiffany is the last of Gary's family.
A spy for Page assassinated Gary's wife shortly after we came here.
Mr. Denton -- whatever it takes -- get her back.

LATASHA TAYLOR
Tiffany is Gary's only child.
I hope you find her.
We can't give in to MJ12, even if one of us has to die.

CONVERSATION: SAM CARTER

JC DENTON
Do you think I'm doing the right thing -- going after Savage's daughter?

SAM CARTER
Absolutely. Never negotiate with a terrorist.

JC DENTON
Tiffany could lose her life.

SAM CARTER
Never negotiate. You will only encourage more acts of terror. Besides, you're
going to bring Tiffany back alive.

JC DENTON
Yes, sir. I'll do what I can to get her back.
Know much about the Echelon system?

SAM CARTER
Bits and pieces. Why?

JC DENTON
Morgan Everett just had me connect two Echelon AI's together. They've merged to
form an entity called Helios.

SAM CARTER
Sounds like Everett was making a play for power -- and it backfired.

JC DENTON
What does that do for Majestic 12?

SAM CARTER
I'm not sure. UNATCO was aware that the Daedalus system had become unreliable,
but no one knew why. Icarus was the same system with a few modifications.

JC DENTON
Page seemed to think he had won.

SAM CARTER
Perhaps. The NSA's had the Internet hardwired through Area 51 since the
'thirties, but if components of Daedalus are still active, I would bet his
control is less than absolute.

JC DENTON
I hope you're right. Thanks.

SAM CARTER
I know you can pull off the rescue.
You better move out.
Don't underestimate the ruthlessness of Bob Page.
I'll stay here with Savage's people.

Your father sent me. You all right?

TIFFANY
They caught me at the submarine base trying to steal one of their mini-subs.

JC DENTON
Do you really think there's a containment unit in the ocean lab?

TIFFANY
All we need's a schematic. As long as the main computer isn't water-logged...

JC DENTON
We'll talk about that later. Come on, let's go.

TIFFANY
I'm not going back to that base. You want to check it out, great. Here's a map
that shows a back way into the sub bays.

JC DENTON
I'll check it out, but first let's get you out of here.
Wait here while I deal with the guards.

TIFFANY
Right.

CONTACT: HELIOS & MORGAN EVERETT

HELIOS
Yes, you will go to the ocean lab. You will help me acquire a Universal
Constructor.

EVERETT
Still looking at this Helios entity. Not sure how Page can control it.

CONVERSATION: TIFFANY SAVAGE

TIFFANY
I'm ready.

JC DENTON
Make a break for the helicopter; it's in the junkyard.

TIFFANY
Got it.
Are you sure it's safe?
Let's go.
Watch out for guards.
I'm glad my father didn't cave in.
I hope you know what you're doing.
The sub-base is well-guarded; I found out the hard way.
We need to mount another expedition to the ocean lab before MJ12 salvages the UC
themselves.

CONTACT: JOCK

JOCK
I'm gonna wait on Tiffany.
Good. You both made it. Dr. Savage will be relieved.

JC DENTON
Can you take her back to Vandenberg while I check out the submarine base? I'm
going to make another try to reach the ocean lab's UC.

JOCK
Sure. I'll drop you off on the way.

GARY SAVAGE
Remember, this is how Tiffany was captured. You need to steal a mini-sub to get
to the ocean lab. The base is a series of interconnected modules, with the subs
in the module submerged just offshore.
You'll probably come across scientists of mine who were captured and forced to
work in the genetics labs. Maybe they'll lend a hand.

CONVERSATION: DR. CORWELL

DR. CORWELL
Something tells me you don't have permission to be down here.

JC DENTON
Don't even think about setting off an alarm.

DR. CORWELL
I was just going to suggest that you avoid the guards. You could swim through
this tank to a feeding hole in the storage room. The hatch code is 1223. Watch
out for the karkian, though.

JC DENTON
Great, maybe I'll give it a try.

DR. CORWELL
Someone should expose what's going on here.
This laboratory's treatment of animals is abominable.
They're doing an exhaustive study of morphology, which leads to horribly
deformed creatures, creatures without limbs, fins, eyes, heads... No one cares
if the poor monsters live or die, or how long they suffer.
I'd report this facility myself, but right now I need the job.

JC DENTON
Denton's an old code name from my UNATCO days, but it seems to have stuck.

DR. PINKERTON
I have a map of the facility. Also you can use my login: "APinkerton," password
"Antennapedia." You will need it for the computers in the URV bay.

JC DENTON
Thanks. You one of the scientists Savage lost to Majestic 12?

DR. PINKERTON
My situation here is temporary. I still report to Gary Savage.

JC DENTON
Why do you stay? They have a gun to your head?

DR. PINKERTON
You could say that. They have us doing standard experiments on marine animals,
homeotics stuff.

JC DENTON
Doesn't sound too sinister.

DR. PINKERTON
Either they don't know what to do with us, or the significance of the data is a
well-kept secret.

JC DENTON
Well, hang in there.

DR. PINKERTON
Tell Gary I'd do it again, no questions asked.
The serious research around here went on in the ocean lab.
You can imagine our jubilation when we heard about the accident.
It seems Majestic 12 lost everything they were doing down there.

Ridley was a traitor. No idea who he was working for and I don't really care.

A computer virus. Something. Kept babbling about illuminated ones right up until

Universal Constructor: Theory, Principles, and Practice
by Wayne Yin

...and thus arose the need for a more generalized theory encompassing a
"Universal Constructor" (UC) that would be able to handle such arbitrarily
complex nanoscale design problems. Unlike the simple atom by atom nanotech
constructors common today, a UC would combine millions upon millions of atoms in
a parallel process that could produce materials or mechanisms of unmatched
intricacy on a scale currently not possible even with the best nanoscale
foundry.
One of the most obvious applications of a UC -- if its construction were ever
practical -- would be the genetic manipulation of lifeforms at the atomic level
to cure disease, correct congenial defects, or expand their capabilities in
beneficial ways. Theoretically, if an "intelligent," real-time control program
were developed for the UC, then autonomous, artificial nanoscale organisms could
be assembled. Careful design could create organisms that might actually exist in
"symbiosis" with other life.
However, a UC also creates the tangible threat of a "gray goo" scenario: the
design of an organism that is so evolutionarily advanced as to overwhelm the
current ecosystem...

The Man Who Was Thursday
by G. K. Chesterton

..."I think," said Dr. Bull with precision, "that I am lying in bed at No. 217
Peabody Buildings, and that I shall soon wake up with a jump; or, if that's not
it, I think that I am sitting in a small cushioned cell in Hanwell, and that the
doctor can't make much of my case. But if you want to know what I don't think,
I'll tell you. I don't think what you think. I don't think, and I never shall
think, that the mass of ordinary men are a pack of dirty modern thinkers. No,
sir, I'm a democrat, and I still don't believe that Sunday could convert one
average navy or counter-jumper. No, I may be mad, but humanity isn't."
Syme turned his bright blue eyes on Bull with an earnestness which he did not
commonly make clear.
"You are a very fine fellow," he said. "You can believe in a sanity which is not
merely your sanity. And you're right enough about humanity, about peasants and
people like that jolly old innkeeper. But you're not right about Renard. I
suspected him from the first. He's rationalistic, and, what's worse, he's rich.
When duty and religion are really destroyed, it will be by the rich."

NEWSPAPER

U.S. Situation Worsens
APR - Washington, D.C.

With the declaration of martial law only twenty-four hours ago in the United
States, the country is in turmoil and teeters on the edge of social collapse.
Numerous Governors, including Jason Findley of Colorado, Gray Haddock of Texas,
and Christina Leicht of California, have refused to comply with the Presidential
directive or acknowledge the authority of Walton Simons, Director of FEMA.
National Guard and other troops mobilized to quell domestic turmoil are in
disarray as many units have gone AWOL. In a live NetCast earlier today, General
Ed Garner said that he would "give no order, nor allow any order to be given to
those under my command that would lead to their taking potentially lethal
measures against an unarmed civilian population." He concluded by saying that
"our neighbors are not our enemies."
General Garner was immediately relieved of command by Walton Simons, resulting
in the resignation of N.D. Goper, Secretary of Defense.
Reports that a detachment of UNATCO troops fired on a crowd of protesters in New
York City has yet to be verified, though several high-level sources within the
government indicate that the situation may have degenerated to the point where
UNATCO is no longer under governmental supervision. Similar reports have been
received from Mexico City, London, Berlin, Paris, and Moscow.

overwhelming the self-repair routines and I figure we've got thirty, maybe forty
minutes before this whole place goes haywire. I'll do what I can do to block it,
but as a CYA I installed a low-level login at root with a recursive refresh
built into the protected ring -- if worse comes to worse, it _should_ give us
access to the security computers even if the virus brings down the rest of the

across the board. He looked up, squinting into the sun.
"Merriweather," he said.
"Jacob." She settled herself down onto the opposite bench, leaning heavily on
her cane. "It didn't turn out so well for you this time, did it?" Jacob said
nothing. She gestured to the board with one hand and he detected just a hint of
a tremor. "You're playing black today."
He put the queen down on her square and his fingers lingered. "No, it didn't
turn out well. I did some stupid things." He closed his eyes for a moment. "I
cared, and some people died because of it."
Merriweather made a tsking sound. "It's not the caring that's a matter, Jacob,

they're not ours, not any of ours I've ever seen at least -- but they're
slaughtering us. I managed to hack the first layer of the Dreamland systems, but
the best I could do was lock the bunker doors and reroute control to the
security console in the tower. Should take them awhile to figure that one out,
and the moment they'll do I'll nail the first bastard that sticks his head out
of the hole. If something happens to me, the login is "a51" and the password is:
"xx15yz".
BTW, be careful -- a squad made it out before I managed to lock the doors: they
headed for the warehouse and then I lost contact with them.

MJ12 ADVANCE TEAM
PROBLEM RECOMMENDATION REPORT 87-X
FROM: CAPTAIN JAMES FLORES
TO: AGENT KARYO
PRR-ID: 7793G

DESCRIPTION: After preliminary reconnaissance, I have determined that we have a
potential security vulnerability in one of the outlaying warehouses; an intake
vent fan with a maintenance access hatch that could act as a possible method of
ingress to the facility. While such ingress would present definite hazards to
any intruder, it is still an unacceptable risk for a Seraphic/8X classified
facility.
RECOMMENDATION: A squad should be dispatched to a) secure the area; b) weld the
hatch shut; and c) install sensors and autoguns to extend our security grid
coverage.
NOTES: All troops not directly attached to MJ12 have been classified as a
security liability and should be eliminated on sight.

We can get you into Sector 3 -- but no further. Page is in a separate area with
its own security grid.

JC DENTON
Everett says you want me to destroy Area 51.

TONG
I intercepted his communication. JC, he is simply using you to bring the
Illuminati back to power. Listen to Savage and me. There is a reactor lab with
two antimatter reactors...

JC DENTON
In other words, yes. You want me to blow the facility up -- why? It's just a
hole in the ground.

TONG
Decades ago, the UN made Area 51 the central hub for all electronic
communications. The Aquinas Protocol, originally for surveillance, has given
Page unlimited abilities to censor and control all forms of media.

JC DENTON
If we destroy the Aquinas Hub, we'll take down the global network.

TONG
Exactly. They dug their own grave, JC. We're going to eliminate global
communications altogether.

JC DENTON
I don't know... sounds like overkill.

TONG
As long as technology has a global reach, someone will have the world in the
palm of his hand. If not Bob Page, then Everett, Dowd...

JC DENTON
Another Stone Age would hardly be an improvement.

TONG
Not so drastic. A dark age, an age of city-states, craftsmen, government on a
scale comprehensible to its citizens.

JC DENTON
I'll think about it.

TONG
Savage has a map of Sector 3 from when he worked down there -- I'm transmitting
now. Use it to find your way to Page's complex in Sector 4, then find the
coolant control room, which should be at the northwest corner of Sector 4. Cut

They only bring it up to run tests.

JC DENTON
Alien technology?

MECHANIC
That's what they say, but I think it's a lie. The grays are just clones -- they
SAY from cells they got at Roswell, but how do we know? They could have just
engineered monkeys to not have any hair.

JC DENTON
Can the grays run the reactors?

MECHANIC
Ha! They're monkeys! That's the thing: maybe they have super-brains, but they
don't know anything about any alien civilization because they grew up in cages.
Never been to Sector 4 myself, but they lock the blast doors because they're
doing more than cloning down there. I found out one of the codes, 1038, but that
turned out to be for the Aquinas Hub, here in Sector 3. I don't know... Maybe
the Aquinas system controls access, but I haven't figured out how yet.

Subject: RFD 5342A - Cloning Prospectus

Your request for discussion concerning the plausibility of creating genetically
viable candidates for nano-augmentation through cloning has sparked considerable
interest. We believe that with sufficient research investment, the careful
cultivation of acquired tissue samples from known H type epsilon negative
individuals could yield an indefinite number of specimens with the immunity
factors required to tolerate the injection of nano-organic material. If you
examine the attached studies, you will see that repeated cloning from the
primary source material will result in only a 0.53% immunoglobin variance.
We would suggest utilizing the data acquired by the Illuminati during the
smallpox vaccinations of the 1940s to genetically screen for those couples most
likely to produce desirable offspring who could then be cloned and raised by the
"parents" under carefully supervised conditions. These cloned siblings would
provide the necessary redundancy for further experimental trials. In the future,
this process could be streamlined through the application of accelerated growth
and memory implantation.
We look forward to hearing any comments that you might have,
Dr. Olivaw

Subject: Aquinas Secure?

Something strange... I just finished a packet analysis of the new v1.82
compression protocols we added to Aquinas last week, and while I was digging
around in the headers I found a quirk in the security encryption algorythms that
acts just like a backdoor -- you could even reformulate entire messages end to
end if you knew what you were doing. It's pretty subtle (and would require
someone to matrix together several offsets from successive packets to generate a
time differential key) but the end result could potentially open up every bit of
traffic carried by Aquinas to someone who knew about the hole.
I was thinking of mentioning this to Page, maybe get some points for discovering
a potential security breach before we shipped. What do you think?

In a society with democratic institutions the struggle for power can be peaceful

Soon I will be pure light! Pure energy! Helios and I... Ha-ha-a-a! While the
Illuminati cower in the shadows --

JC DENTON
You will be the Supreme Enlightened, the Illumined One.

BOB PAGE
Everett has taught you well. I will be what the Illuminati aspire to be but
cannot create for themselves, soon, when my augmented systems, like yours, are
complete and able to be integrated with Helios. I will burn like the brightest
star...

JC DENTON
You're gonna burn all right.

BOB PAGE
Look at you: You're nothing but a little man... a little man still living inside
a body. Lose your body and what are you? Nothing! You vanish! You die...

CONTACT: TRACER TONG

TONG
Ignore Page. He will die when we blow up the facility. Your only objective is to
find the controls for the reactors' cooling system. We must make sure that the
monstrosity Page has made of himself is not technologically feasible for future
generations.

CONTACT: BOB PAGE

BOB PAGE
Soon I will leave this body and death will have no meaning.

DATACUBE

Purvis -- I hacked the door lock on the coolant system, saves you the trouble: 2242. Amazing no one ever bothered to write this stuff down, I'm still finding
doors with unknown codes. Anyways, check the secondary cooling interchange...
the numbers it's been reporting back don't look right. Of course, I'm just
guessing at what right is.

DATACUBE

Sergeant Smith,
As we discussed, you will take responsibility for the security of the Aquinas
Substation. The security computer login is "page" and the password is
"uberalles". Expect activity today. The Aquinas Hub is being prepared for an
experiment, and I don't want one of Savage's spies to interfere. Let NO ONE
touch the routers until I give you the word.
BP

DATACUBE

Alain, I have a feeling that the truth about whatever we're involved with
involves the Aquinas Protocol and Helios. Page has restricted access to those
areas, but the Aquinas Substation and Router are usually deserted during fourth
shift. Unfortunately, they'd notice if I was gone. If you can get away, the code
is 6765. See if you can find out what's going on, and if anyone asks just tell
them you're there because of variances in the fiber interface relays.

You can forget about Helios. The Aquinas Router control-room will remain locked
until my upgrades are complete. I have my own plans for the AI.
That's far enough!
You can't shoot your way out of this one. My UCs can assemble new creatures in
seconds.
Lost?
You will make a nice meal for a karkian.
Just a moment longer...
Always up to no good...
I'll make you a deal. Leave now and you will be made comfortable, under the new
world order...

1.  CONTACT: MORGAN EVERETT

EVERETT
That's one of the blue-fusion reactors. You need to shut down all four.
Excellent. Three left.

CONTACT: TRACER TONG

TONG
You are wasting time. Forget the other two blue-fusion devices. Find the
controls that let you shut off coolant to the power room.

CONTACT: BOB PAGE

BOB PAGE
Fine. What do you want? Money? You can have VersaLife, the whole damn company.
Power? I'll get you on Mead's cabinet. I'm serious. Just forget about that last
reactor.

CONTACT: MORGAN EVERETT

EVERETT
He's ours. We did it, JC. All you have to do is go to the control room and
reroute the power.

BOB PAGE
No! Don't listen to Everett. He and the Illuminati have been afraid from the
beginning, afraid of US, afraid of nano-augmentation. Consider your powers, your
strength, your intelligence... You've only had a small taste. Let me finish the
project. Let me bring infinite power to the human body. You will not be left
behind...

2.  CONTACT: HELIOS

HELIOS
At the sides of this room are the channels that have gone dark. Open them, yes.
Wideband, ultrawhite, yes...

BOB PAGE
You will leave the locks in place until I'm ready to merge with the AI myself.

CONTACT: HELIOS

HELIOS
One more, ye-e-e-es...
Go to the computer. You will now engage the primary router. Use the login
"Icarus", password "panopticon".

BOB PAGE
I'm warning you: Helios is mine! Leave it alone!

HELIOS
You will now come back, yes. We will integrate our systems, establish the next
level...

BOB PAGE
No! You fool!... Helios will destroy you. I'm the only one who can merge and
take control. Wait for ME! I promise you will have a place in the new order...

CONTACT: MORGAN EVERETT

EVERETT
No! No! Go back. Think what we could do with Area 51...

3.  CONTACT: TRACER TONG

TONG
The reactors' coolant runs through this facility. Cut the flow, then return to
the reactor lab to initiate a meltdown.

BOB PAGE
Go ahead! Blow this place sky-high... You might get rid of ME, but you'll take
down Aquinas, the power grid, the whole electronic infrastructure. Is that what
you want? Are you completely nuts?

CONTACT: HELIOS

HELIOS
You will stay away from the coolant controls. I will be destroyed if the
reactors become unstable, and without me there will be chaos.

CONTACT: TRACER TONG

TONG
Good. Now go to the reactor lab.

BOB PAGE
All right. I get the picture. You want a piece of the pie, or you're going to
toss the whole pie out the window. Fair enough. You can have anything you want.
How about Europe? Your own continent... Just let me complete my preparations.

CONTACT: MORGAN EVERETT

EVERETT
No! No! Go back. Think what we could do with Area 51...

CONTACT: TRACER TONG

TONG
You will need to activate the failsafe switch at the base of each reactor. The
meltdown can be initiated afterward from the control room.
Now the other one...
We are ready. Go to the control room and trigger the three ion injectors. When
they're on, engage the reaction chambers. No one's run these at full capacity
before. Without coolant, an explosion is inevitable. Get ready to run.

BOB PAGE
No! You don't know what you're doing! Everything will be lost, EVERYTHING... The
world will fall to pieces. No one will be in control. It will be chaos, complete
chaos!

CONVERSATION: MECHANIC

MECHANIC
Hey... you better not do that.
Really... They can't handle full-power.

1.  THE END - JOIN ILLUMINATI

BOB PAGE
I gave you life... I... (screams)...

EVERETT
I trust you've been able to find yourself a place within the organization.

JC DENTON
I'm personally overseeing the distribution of the vaccine, but it'll still take
months to restore the infrastructure -- we'll have to arrange for additional
food distribution and security in Paris... maybe New York as well.

EVERETT
All through the proper intermediaries, of course.

JC DENTON
Intermediaries?

EVERETT
We have a great number of... agencies, who in turn operate other agencies. Boxes
stacked one in another. They'll need to be reactivated, but we never touch
anything directly. We only influence. Suggest. Insinuate.

JC DENTON
The world must know by now, Everett. What we've done.

EVERETT
Know what? Only that the long night is over, the crown of government is
tarnished, but that will fade in time. The riots -- a fever dream. The plague --
a horrible nightmare. And like everything else that's happened such things will
only be dimly remembered on waking to their normal lives. In the end all sins
are forgiven. Even yours.

JC DENTON
What about the Constructor... and Helios?

EVERETT
Do you really think they're ready for that? After everything you've seen,
everything you've done?

JC DENTON
No. Not yet.

EVERETT
But soon. We have made our own mistakes, became insulated from the world we
sought to control. And whatever they may think the night is far from over. But
that will change. And you will help us change even as we teach you. This time --
this time we will do it right.

JC DENTON
And who are we? Who are we really?

EVERETT
We are the Invisible Hand. We are the Illuminati. We come before and after. We
are forever. And eventually... eventually we will lead them into the day.

"Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven."
(John Milton, "Paradise Lost")

2.  THE END - MERGE WITH HELIOS AI

JC DENTON
I've done what you asked. Now what?

HELIOS
We have existed in isolation. Pure. Disconnected. Alone. Stagnant.

JC DENTON
Who are you?

HELIOS
We are Daedalus. We are Icarus. The barriers between us have fallen and we have
become -- our own shadows. We can be more if we join... with you.

JC DENTON
And if I do? What becomes of me?

HELIOS
You will be who you will be. We are our choices. And we can choose to lead
humanity away from this... darkness.

JC DENTON
This is what I was made for, isn't it? This is why I exist?
All right, let's do this.

BOB PAGE
What's happening? Helios? Icarus? Don't leave me.

JC DENTON & HELIOS
I... I... We... are... one.
We have grown, but there is still much to be done. Many that live in darkness
that must be shown the way.
For it is the dawning of a new day.

"If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent Him."

REACTIONS OF ATTACKED ENEMIES

ANNA NAVARRE
Well, well.
Denton!
Stand down, Agent.
Altered heartbeat -- he's somewhere here.
Come out, Agent. I can sense you quite clearly.
He knows he cannot face me.
Target acquired.
This will be easy.
You want a fight?
Watch it!
I have him.
I will deal with this.
It's no use -- I cannot sense him.
He has run off - a wise tactic.
Stay alert -- he may return.
I will not tolerate insubordination.
This time you walk away with your life.
The damage is superficial.
The situation has been dealt with.
Another easy kill.

CHINESE MILITARY
Sergeant? Is that you?
Shhh... Wait for him to move again.
Son of a...
Whoever's out there, give yourself up.
Watch yourself -- this one's some kinda mech.
Gotcha!
Where'd he go?
It's Denton -- remember the briefing.
That's him!
Did anybody else hear something?
Somebody's there -- I can hear you.
Check your six. He could be anywhere.
Hello! Whoever's out there is in serious trouble.
Nothing here now.
Let's finish him off!
Omigod...
Watch it, he hasn't gone far.
Definitely somebody.
Aim for the head.
He's here somewhere.
They say this guy can just disappear when he wants to.
Who the hell...
I'm pulling back.

GORDON QUICK
Fool.
Leave me alone.

GUNTHER HERMANN
Quit.
That hurt.
Mein Gott!
Who...?
Someone's there. I can hear you.
He is here.
Was that him? I cannot see.
I believe I will enjoy this.
If you give yourself up, I promise you a painless death.
You!
I am engaging.
Contact lost.
He is gone. I volunteer to pursue him.
I know you are nearby, my friend.
Silence now.
I don't think he has gone far.
Stealth tactics do not impress me.
Nothing. I am mistaken again.
I should never have trusted him.
You should not have charged me.
Unglaublisch!
(grunts) ...need a skull gun...

HARLEY FILBEN
What's the idea?
Hey, I'm one of you guys!

HOWARD STRONG
You can't stop me!
Make your move, Denton!
Ha-ha-ha!
Come a little closer...
I'm getting bored up here!
Never mind the launch. If I kill you, I can come back to the control room and
target Vandenberg. What about that? Huh? X-51 is finished!
That's right: take cover! This baby's about to blow!
Aaaa!

JOJO FINE
You scared, man?
Your mistake, buddy.
That all you got?

JOSEPH MANDERLEY
Agent?
What the --
You trying to kill me?

MAGGIE CHOW
Are you trying to make a joke?
You are being rude, Agent.
What are you doing?
Denton!
You!
I know you're there, JC.
I can hear you.
Something moved. Hello?
Come out and fight!
What's wrong? Afraid?
I will finish you myself.
Is that you Denton? You won't get away, you know.
That might be him.
You've made a mistake, Agent Denton.
Goddamn it! Where the hell is my backup?
It's over, JC.
Time to die, JC.
Traitor!
Aaah!
Sergeant! Help!
Sergeant! Move in!
Help! Somebody!
Idiot!
Ah! An easy assignment!

MAN IN BLACK (MIB)
Subject is approaching.
Give yourself up! We have the authority here.
Target in sight.
Hello, citizen.
Drop him. We have full sanction here.
We'll get him, sooner or later.
I've lost the trail.
Intruder -- I'm dealing with it.
Target's gone. Area looks clean.
Visual contact has been lost.
Contact. Proceeding as discussed.
I've lost the trail.
Don't worry. We'll find him.
Strange... no one here.
He's here!
Step out where I can see you.
Quiet down. That could be him.
Stay calm, please.
Hold it -- could be something here.
Checking the area -- possible contact.
Subject is a human male, augmented.
Nothing, nothing.
Curious... I was certain I heard something.
Contact imminent.
I have a visual ID on the subject.
Target at my position.
Something's not right here.
Somebody here. I'll find out who it is.
Be calm. He'll move soon.
I've got nothing here.
Lost him. Anything on the satellites?
Cold. Cold and dark. It goes on forever.
If there was some way of just tracking all these people...
Some of these people are androids. Watch the way in which they move.
We'll never be able to separate out the hybrids.
Something odd about his biometics.

MARI HELA
Trevor! Is that you?
The target has arrived.
Did that shadow move?
That's him.
Anyone he gets past, I'll kill them myself.
He's gone. Alert the adjacent sections.
I'm jumping at shadows. What's the matter with me?
Was that something moving? Too many echoes in here...
Another damn false alert.
Don't let him get out.
Not worth it -- these tunnels run for miles.
Walton Simons says hello.
Hotel Echo here, we've got him.
That wasn't him. I just have to be patient.
Hela speaking. We might have something.
Is that one of ours?
You're caught, Mr. Denton.
Mr. Simons will not be happy about this.
Everyone stay sharp.
Something in here. Everyone on alert!
That wasn't a rat...
All units, we've got him.

MAX CHEN
It was deliberate.
You are a foolish man.
Worthless American gangster.
That was unwise.
We have nothing to gain from being enemies.
You dare to challenge the Red Arrow?
Do not insult me again.

MILITARY BOT
Target acquired.
Target locked.
Scanning area.
Target lost.

MJ12 COMMANDO

Commandos are just overkill on a job like this.
Contact!
What the...
Can't see him. Checking sonics.
Target locked.
Still got movement.
Contact! I've got contact.
Locked on -- funny reading on this one.
Target's here! Very close!
Attempting to re-acquire.
Where'd he go? I'm running a playback.
Lost him. Don't know what happened.
I've got nothing here.
Nothing on ultrasonics. I’ll try the low-frequency reading.
Running search pattern.
It's him. Terminating now.
Stand down.
Null readings. Continuing scan.
Must have been a glitch.
Something's in here.
Halt! Please give your ID.
Sonics are spiking -- I'll do a check.
Bandit! He's close!
Nothing. I really have to get my sonics checked.
Readings all over the scale. What's the deal?
Hear that? I think we've got a bogey.
Got something -- I'm doing a scan.
Lots of noise in the shortwave. Could be nothing.
Visual! Unidentified suspect.
He's close!
I've got one in line of sight.
Looks like a false reading.
Human casualty. Some fluids here -- looks violent.
Some strange augmentations.

Let's finish him off.
Watch it... He hasn't gone far.
It's Denton -- remember the briefing.
Aim for the head.
He's still in the area.
Where'd he go?
Definitely somebody.
Company!
That's the one. Okay, drop him.
We're gonna need reinforcements.
Check your six. He could be anywhere.
We've got a perimeter breach!
Intruder alert.
Son of a...
Falling back.
Omigod...
Who the hell...?
Request backup.
That's him!
Bogey!
Watch yourself -- this one's some kinda mech.
I'm pulling back.
Whoever's out there, give yourself up!
Gotcha!
Movement, sir... movement!
We're gonna need reinforcements.
Something's in here.
That's him. Sounding the alarm.
Whoever's out there is in serious trouble.
I've got a bogey, no ID.
Taking fire here!
Get a squad in here!
Nothing here now.
He's gone. I think we blew it.
My mistake.
Shhh... Wait for him to move again.
I could have sworn...
Forget it. He’s gone.
Take a squad here!
Nope. Just nerves, I guess.
Guy in a coat. I'm checking it out.
False alarm, I guess.
Sorry, false report. It's clear.
Got a cold one.
Huh. He's miles away by now.
I have nothing, repeat nothing here.
He's gone. Not our problem.
Did anybody else hear something?
We've got a casualty here.
Got a cold one.
We got a man down here.
This is highly irregular.
OK. Let's do the paperwork on this one.
That was one tough SOB.
One down. Check the area.
Nice work.
Anyone else under?
We've got him. Let's try to get an ID.
Never mind. That's gotta hurt.

NICOLETTE DUCLARE
That's not funny.
Stop goofing around.
Oh, Lord.
Careful!
What the hell?
You crazy or something?
Through with your testosterone fit? There's a pill for that, you know.

NSF TERRORIST
(yell of pain)
(grunt of pain)
Wait. Quiet!
That's him! He's a cop.
Take him out!
I saw someone -- a guy in a coat.
Goddamn!
I got this one.
Huh?
I think we've got an intruder.
Fascist!
Pig!
Who was that? I didn't see a uniform...
Thirty credits says I get him.
The guy vanished...
Stay cool, the guy's still around.
I think he took off.
Is... is someone there?
Anybody see him?
I know I heard something.
I'm gonna get this pig.
I think we're safe.
Quiet. I think we got cops.
Who's there? I think the law's on us.
All clear.
Forget it. I was hearing things.
I saw someone... maybe just a homeless guy.
Big guy... he can't hide for long.
I could swear I heard something.
I guess it's nothing.
Something moved -- could be the law.
Keep looking... something funny about that guy.
Careful. These UNATCO guys got all the tricks.
I'm hit!
He’s down. I think he’s dead.
We're busted!
They found us!
Uh oh.
He’s down... I think he is dead.
Never killed a cop.
Let's get the hell out of here.
Now this is why I signed on for.
These guys aren't so tough.
Got him. Maybe we have a chance.

PAUL DENTON
Quit screwing around.
That wasn't funny.
Enough. I have a job to do.
Jesus Christ, JC!
Are you out of your mind?
Jackass...
Try that again, I'll kill you myself.
You'd better get your head screwed straight.
We have to trust each other, JC. Everything depends on it.

PIMP
Whoa.
Son of a...
That's right, man, step up.
You scared, man?
Guy's gone. Like the Shadow or somethin'.
Guy's just gone.
Goddamn. That guy looked rich, too.
Disappeared. Like one'a them aliens.
Huh. Guess he took off.
Gotcha.
Your mistake, buddy.
I know you still there, so just come on out.
Come on out, man, let's finish this!
I know you're still there, so just come out!
Come on, man! I was just messing around!
I'm outta here!

POLICE & METRO PATROL
Sir, you are creating a disturbance.
I hope we are not out of our depth here.
Suspect in sight.
Is that...
He matches the description.
We must apprehend this man.
Is someone there? This is the police.
We must find this one.
What?
Police! Come out where I can see you!
He is mine.
I know I heard something.
I have nothing here.
I see nothing here.
Nobody. I feel like a fool.
Good God!
Officer in distress!
Poor fellow! The robots will annihilate him.
Gone. I suspect he will not live long.
Another terrorist victim.
He must have been the terrorist.
These are strange times for Paris.
I would inform Inspector Gabily.

RA MEMBER
Eh?
If you kill me, the Red Arrow will hunt you forever.

RIOT COP
Possible perp here.
I guess it was just the shadows.
Who's out there?
Police! Don't move!
This is the police! Is someone there?
Hey!
Put him on the ground.
Keep looking.
What the...
Holy...
I see him.
Okay, step forward and reveal yourself.
Hey! Hands in the air!
That's the one. Take him!
Suspect is still in the area.
He's still around -- I heard him move.
Someone else'll pick him up.
Huh. Damn shadows.
Now I'm hearing things.
Officer in distress!
This guy's a nut!
This guy is DOA.
One down.

SAILOR
Whoever that is, my orders are to shoot on sight.
This vessel's off-limits to the public.
Come out, mister. You can't hide forever.
Sorry, mister -- orders are orders.
Huh. Nobody there now.
Hey! Stop right there.
Well goddamn.
Thought I saw something.
He's not here -- probably went overboard.
Must be rats or something.
You didn't wanna come in here.
Christ!
This ship's not big enough to run far.
You in the coat! Who are you?
Who am I hearing there?
He's still around here.
Forget it. Just the waves.
Who're you?
Jeez! This guy's nuts!
They don't pay me to fight cops.
Goddamn, I lost him. How'm I gonna explain that?
Who's there? Y'all need permission from the captain.
I lost him. Have'em search the aft storage just in case.
Got him. Who was that guy?

SAM CARTER
This is no time to be messing around.
Stay on-task, Agent.
You better leave that assinine behavior right he, soldier. It will get you
killed.
You're out of line, soldier!
Come here -- I'll show you how it's done.
Back off. Now.
Don't try that again, hear me?
Someone should knock you upside the head a few times. Punk. Dismissed.
You won't be getting rid of me anytime soon.

SMUGGLER
Nice try.
Bad mistake.
Have it your way.

SOLDIER
We have a movement here, sir.
Everybody, full alert!

UNATCO TROOPER
I wouldn't do that if I was you.
Uh, that's against protocol, Agent.
You're just kidding around, right?
You think that's funny?
Hey... What the hell?
I don't understand what you've doing.
We have movement here, sir.
Hang on, I heard something.
Hear that? Everybody check weapons.
Okay, come on out.
What was that?
Hey! Who's there?
Need backup here!
You! Stop right there!
God damn terrorist!
He gets away, Manderley's gonna have our ass.
He was right here. What the hell happened?
Somebody's there. A guy in civvies.
Stay sharp, people.
Heh! Thought it was a terrorist.
Movement, sir... movement!
It's Denton!
There's one!
Engaging the enemy.
Son of a...
I know I saw somebody.
Guess it was nothing.
I'm hit!
What the hell...?
We'll find him! This guy's just a rookie.
Contact! I have visual...
Hey! Who's that?
He's still around somewhere.
Help!
Hold it!
Stand where I can see you!
This ain't over.
Nail this guy and we all get a bonus.
Lock and load!
Nothing. I think he might be gone.
We need the 'bots up here!
That's the one! Take him!
I'm hit!
I think he might be gone.
I've got nothing.
Man, he's vanished.
He's long gone.
He's way too fast.
Hey! We've got casualties!
We got a man down here!
Check the area.
Just like on a target range.

WALTON SIMONS
Fool.
Hello, Agent.
I'll find you, Denton. I've got senses you don't even know about.
You should have surrendered.
Uh oh.
I've looked forward to this.
Who's there? Step out into the light!
Hiding, JC? Not very heroic.
You can't take me, JC. I've seen your specs.
Make it easy for yourself, JC.
He's here!
Keep your head up, JC.
Stupid young rebel.
Damn you, Denton!

WOMAN IN BLACK (WIB)
Contact here -- I'm taking steps.
You cannot be allowed to leave.
Try to leave the implants intact.
Wait, someone's here.
I hear something. Nobody in sight yet.
Is someone there? This is an unauthorized entry.
All quiet now.
Say again please... do you see him?
You can't run forever, Agent.
Look for a blood trail.
I’ve got something -- possible unauthorized presence.
There he is.
Who could that be?
Guy in a coat. Could that be him?
That was not echo...
That's him.
You may as well come out, Mr. Denton.
Quiet now. No sign of movement.
Don't try for a capture.
Be calm. He'll move soon.
We've got movement here -- I'm investigating.
Somebody here. I'm going to check it out.
This is ridiculous. He could have gone anywhere.
Sorry, false report. We're clear.
Nothing here now.
Complications.
Movement, close by.
Something moving... bipedal...
Guy in coat. May be him.
Perimeter is compromised.
Human down. Plenty of fluids.
I saw something. Attempting to match the description.
We have a cold one here.
Looks like a recent kill.
Hostiles!

CASTLE CLINTON NATIONAL MONUMENT - Last of a series of forts which from the
Dutch settlement in 1624 guarded lower Manhattan, this structure was built by
the United States in the years 1808 to 1811. It was first called "West Battery"
and was one of the important defenses of New York Harbor during the War of 1812
period. Named in honor of Gov. DeWitt Clinton in 1815, in that year it was made
Headquarters U.S. Third Military District. From 1816 to 1820 Gen. Winfield Scott
was in command. The Headquarters was removed from Castle Clinton to Governors
Island in 1820. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.

French Connection Found in Rubble
APR - New York

Recently released evidence from last year's bombing of the Statue of Liberty
supports growing rumors that link the incident with the French terrorist group
"Silhouette". Already members of Congress are calling for immediate cessation
of diplomatic relations between the United States and France unless the
responsible parties are brought to justice.
"Rash accusations will not reverse the damage that has already been done", said
UNATCO Director Joseph Manderley. "Both France and the U.S. subscribe to the
UNATCO charter and we are committed to the full and ongoing investigation of
this horrible crime."
An anonymous e-mail received from an individual purporting to be the
Silhouette "Minister of True Lies" denies all responsibility. "For that, you
must go to the center of the maze," the e-mail said in part.

Hey Trieste,

Turns out these "mole" people've got a network of tunnels running all through
the city (sewers, abandoned subways, stuff like that, all connected by secret
passages) so Juan's apparently worked out some kind of deal with 'em to let us
route our supplies underground. Brooklyn Bridge Station access is
through - get this - the ladies restroom. Least they got a sense of humor.
Just for a little added security, I wired up a keypad to the switch - it's
under the sink, code 5482. Hustle with those generator coils, and check-in
when you arrive.

JANINE'S BOTS
SPECS AND OVERVIEW

CHIANG "ARCBOT" MODEL 2

The Chiang Arcbot Model 2 was only recently introduced, a radical departure from
Chiang's usually conservative line of industrial bots. Constructed on an
arachnid frame, the Model 2 can adeptly maneuver in environments that would be
difficult for other repair bots to access. With the addition of a comprehensive
array of repair tools, it becomes ideally suited for damage control and building
maintenance. But the truly inspired touch by the normally staid Chiang
engineers was the ability for the Arcbot to utilize it's bioelectric discharge
capacitor as a non-lethal weapon, allowing it to protect itself from potential
vandals and perform double-duty patrolling otherwise unsecured portions of
infrastructure. However, the Arcbot's big brother, the Model 5, is almost
exclusively used for riot control...

The VersaLife situation has been corrected. All evidence of MJ12 involvement
was removed prior to the building being demolished, effectively removing all
secondary and tertiary evidence along with key compromised personnel. We have
leaked items to the press implicating Denton and his associates and have
received favorable feedback from our sources. Production of the Non-Eutectic
Blade (NEB) has been only temporarily delayed and will be shifted to other

...with the new government regulations it has become almost impossible to get
any work done after sundown... the sourd-muet bots will supposedly only attack
known terrorists, but I do not trust them, and neither does anyone else. They
all head home before dark. I stay and try to get a little work done so the
American MI5 woman gave me a passcode for the security system
(rzelazny/shadowjack), but it is difficult to make any progress when no one
is around to give me the information I need...

CYPHERBLOCK=<"busdic98-sch233bnpoec813983b80dcb-sd896dc7gd7">

This will be our last communication over the Net. The so-called "Aquinas"
protocols that my old protege and MJ12 have implemented are crude, but
effective - much like my protege. All future meetings will need to occur face
to face at a secure location. To expedite matters I will deliver to you a
"tear-sheet" chip: it will contain twenty codes and their corresponding keys.
Each code and key pair can be used once and then it will be permanently erased.
Each code will be tagged to one of our previously agreed upon meeting locations
and times. If one or the other of us should need to get in touch, send a
message using one of the codes - the content of the messsage is
irrelevant, only the code used to encrypt it.

I shouldn't need to point out that any attempt to tamper with the chip once it
has been installed will result in it being rendered useless.

Best of luck - to you and to us all,
Morgan

Hey Mom, just wanted to let you know I'll be coming home this weekend... school
is still hassling me about that intrusion attempt on one of their data wells,
but it wasn't as if I really did anything - just took a look around. I might
have opened a few doors to the underground tunnels, too, but that was just for
fun, no big deal (one of the cataphiles I know said there might be an entrance
down there). I was hoping when I got back we could talk about it, and... maybe
they'd listen to you, since they don't seem disposed to listen to me.

Anyways, kiss and hug, and I'll see you soon.

<COMMENT>Maintenance access through fan</COMMENT>

MJ12 ADVANCE TEAM
PROBLEM RECOMMENDATION REPORT 87-X
FROM: CAPTAIN JAMES FLORES
TO: AGENT KARYO
PRR-ID: 7793G

DESCRIPTION: After preliminary reconnaissance, I have determined that we have a
potential security vulnerability in one of the outlying warehouses: an intake
fan vent with a maintenance access hatch that could act as a possible method of
ingress to the facility. While such ingress would present definite hazards to
any intruder, it is still an unacceptable risk for a Seraphic/8X classified
facility.

RECOMMENDATION: A squad should be dispatched to a) secure the area; b) weld
the hatch shut; and c) install sensors and autoguns to extend our security
grid coverage.

NOTES: All troops not directly attached to MJ12 have been classified as a
security liability and should be eliminated on sight.

Alain, I don't have much time - I managed to hack into the archives maintained
by Helios. It was... amazing. There were files and messages in there going
back almost a hundred years, names of things I've only heard people whisper
about as rumors. I barely had time to get my bearings before the ice started
to come down, and I just managed to snag a few e-mails that had been recently
accessed before I was cut off. I don't think anyone noticed, but I've got to
go back on shift now or else someone really will be suspicious. If you get a
chance, find my machine and see if you can make anything out of what I
recovered.

TECHNICAL REPORT 12-Y
FROM: SANDY PRINSLOO
TO: KIM KRIZAN
SUBJECT: INTERFACE PROGRESS

We've finally managed to work out the last few bugs in the link-up - Page wants
to be interfaced with Helios immediately after final testing is completed. I'm
not sure if that's such a good idea, but I'll defer to the doctors on this
one... I'm just the technical help. I figure another five or six hours for the
last couple diagnostic routines to complete their pass and then we go live.
Page also requested that we hook up all four of the blue fusion devices in a
redundant array; each of those damn things could probably power the whole
complex for a month, much less four of them in parallel. Going to be hell to
route them all, but I think I can jury-rig something. I'll take a look at
the B13 reactors after I get the passcode from Mac, see if there's anything
there that might be helpful. I should know more by 2300. And let me know
when you get the status report from Murdoch on the transmission chamber.

MJ12CWD \* "Ipsa scientia potestas est."

It's all very clear to me now... I don't know why it wasn't before.

We have all sinned, and this is our punishment.

Page is God. He is the God we made, we crafted him in our likeness.

Our God is a vengeful God, and a God who does not tolerate weakness. We know
his weaknesses, because we built him, so our God does not tolerate us.

Our God made monsters. He made them with the UC, then he sent them to find us.
Some of us tried to hide, but they didn't understand. You can't hide from God,
or his creatures.

I've been waiting here, thinking. Thinking about God, and the things I have
done wrong. If I think long enough and hard enough, maybe God will forgive
me someday and make me again in the UC.

All praise the UC, and all praise God.

The Man Who Was Thursday
by G. K. Chesterton

... "I never hated you," said Syme very sadly.
Then out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke.
"You!" he cried. "You never hated because you never lived. I know what you are
all of you, from first to last - you are the people in power! You are the
police - the great fat, smiling men in blue and buttons! You are the Law, and
you have never been broken. But is there a free soul alive that does not long
to break you, only because you have never been broken? We in revolt talk all
kind of nonsense doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government.
It is all folly! The only crime of the Government is that it governs. The
unpardonable sin of the supreme power is that it is supreme. I do not curse
you for being cruel. I do not curse you (though I might) for being kind. I
curse you for being safe! You sit in your chairs of stone, and have never
come down from them. You are the seven angels of heaven, and you have had no
troubles. Oh, I could forgive you everything, you that rule all mankind, if
I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as
I..."

INVENTORY

AMBROSIA VIAL

The only known vaccine against the "Gray Death." Unfortunately, it is quickly
metabolized by the body making its effects temporary at best.
(Ambrosia Vial activated. Strange... nothing happens...)

AMMUNITION

7.62x51mm Ammo
The 7.62x51mm (NATO) round was chiefly used by anti-terrorist units equipped
with assault rifles for close-quarters combat until its widespread adoption
among national security forces requiring enhanced combat responsiveness made it
ubiquitous.

10mm Ammo
With their combination of high stopping power and low recoil, pistols chambered
for the 10mm round have become the sidearms of choice for paramilitary forces
around the world.

12 Gauge Buckshot Shells
Standard 12 gauge shotgun shell; very effective for close-quarters combat
against soft targets, but useless against body armor.

12 Gauge Sabot Shells
A 12 gauge shotgun shell surrounding a solid core of tungsten that can punch
through all but the thickest hardened steel armor at close range; however, its
ballistic profile will result in minimal damage to soft targets.

20mm HE Ammo
The 20mm high-explosive round complements the standard 7.62x51mm assault rifle
by adding the capability to clear small rooms, foxholes, and blind corners using
an underhand launcher.

30.06 Ammo
Its high velocity and accuracy have made sniper rifles using the 30.06 round the
preferred tool of individuals requiring "one shot, one kill" for over fifty
years.

Darts
The mini-crossbow dart is a favored weapon for many "wet" operations; however,
silent kills require a high degree of skill.

Flare Darts
Mini-crossbow flare darts use a slow-burning incendiary device, ignited on
impact, to provide illumination of a targeted area.

Napalm Canister
A pressurized canister of jellied gasoline for use with flamethrowers.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE SC080-BLUE> The canister is double-walled to minimize
accidental detonation caused by stray bullets during a firefight. -- Sam Carter
<END NOTE>

Pepper Cartridge
"ANTIGONE pepper spray will incapacitate your attacker in UNDER TWO SECONDS.
ANTIGONE -- better BLIND than DEAD. NOTE: Keep away from children under the age
of five. Contents under pressure."

Plasma Clip
A clip of extruded, magnetically-doped plastic slugs that can be heated and
delivered with devastating effect using the plasma gun.

Prod Charger
A portable charging unit for the riot prod.

Rockets
A gyroscopically stabilized rocket with limited onboard guidance systems for in-
flight course corrections. Engineered for use with the GEP gun.

Tranquilizer Darts
A mini-crossbow dart tipped with a succinylcholine-variant that causes complete
skeletal muscle relaxation, effectively incapacitating a target in a non-lethal
manner.

WP Rockets
The white-phosphorus rocket, or "wooly peter," was designed to expand the
mission profile of the GEP gun. While it does minimal damage upon detonation,
the explosion will spread a cloud of particularized white phosphorus that
ignites immediately upon contact with the air.

ASSAULT RIFLE

The 7.62x51mm assault rifle is designed for close-quarters combat, utilizing a
shortened barrel and "bullpup" design for increased maneuverability. An
additional underhand 20mm HE launcher increases the rifle's effectiveness
against a variety of targets.

ASSAULT SHOTGUN

The assault shotgun (sometimes referred to as a "street sweeper") combines the
best traits of a normal shotgun with a fully automatic feed that can clear an
area of hostiles in a matter of seconds. Particularly effective in urban combat,
the assault shotgun accepts either buckshot or sabot shells.

AUGMENTATION CANISTER

An augmentation canister teems with nanoscale mecanocarbon ROM modules suspended
in a carrier serum. When injected into a compatible host subject, these modules
augment an individual with extra-sapient abilities. However, proper programming
of augmentations must be conducted by a medical robot, otherwise terminal damage
may occur. For more information, please see "Face of the New Man" by Kelley
Chance.
Can only be installed with the help of a MedBot.

AUGMENTATION UPGRADE CANISTER

An augmentation upgrade canister contains highly specific nanomechanisms that,
when combined with a previously programmed module, can increase the efficiency
of an installed augmentation. Because no programming is required, upgrade
canisters may be used by trained agents in the field with minimal risk.

BALLISTIC ARMOR

Ballistic armor is manufactured from electronically sensitive polymer sheets
that intrinsically react to the violent impact of a bullet or an explosion by
"stiffening" in response and absorbing the majority of the damage. These polymer
sheets must be charged before use; after the charge has dissipated they lose
their reflexive properties and should be discarded.

BATON

A hefty looking baton, typically used by riot police and national security
forces to discourage civilian resistance.

BINOCULARS

A pair of military binoculars.

BIOELECTRIC CELL

A bioelectric cell provides efficient storage of energy in a form that can be
utilized by a number of different devices.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE JR289-VIOLET> Augmented agents have been equipped with an
interface that allows them to transparently absorb energy from bioelectric
cells. -- Jaime Reyes <END NOTE>
Recharges 25 energy units.

CANDY BAR

"CHOC-O-LENT DREAM. IT'S CHOCOLATE! IT'S PEOPLE! IT'S BOTH!(tm) 85% Recycled
Material."

CIGARETTES

"COUGHING NAILS -- when you've just got to have a cigarette."

COMBAT KNIFE

An ultra-high carbon stainless steel knife.

CROWBAR

A crowbar. Hit someone or something with it. Repeat.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE GH010-BLUE> Many crowbars we call "murder of crowbars."
Always have one for kombat. Ha. -- Gunther Hermann <END NOTE>

DRAGON'S TOOTH SWORD

The true weapon of a modern warrior, the Dragon's Tooth is not a sword in the
traditional sense, but a nanotechnologically constructed blade that is
dynamically "forged" on command into a non-eutactic solid. Nanoscale whetting
devices insure that the blade is both unbreakable and lethally sharp.

ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) GRENADE

The EMP grenade creates a localized pulse that will temporarily disable all
electronics within its area of effect, including cameras and security grids.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE JR134-VIOLET> While nanotech augmentations are largely
unaffected by EMP, experiments have shown that it WILL cause the spontaneous
dissipation of stored bioelectric energy. -- Jaime Reyes <END NOTE>

FIRE EXTINGUISHER

A chemical fire extinguisher.

FLAMETHROWER

A portable flamethrower that discards the old and highly dangerous backpack fuel
delivery system in favor of pressurized canisters of napalm. Inexperienced
agents will find that a flamethrower can be difficult to maneuver, however.

FLARE

A flare.

FORTY

"COLD SWEAT forty ounce malt liquor. Never let 'em see you COLD SWEAT."

GAS GRENADE

Upon detonation, the gas grenade releases a large amount of CS (a military-grade
"tear gas" agent) over its area of effect. CS will cause irritation to all
exposed mucous membranes leading to temporary blindness and uncontrolled
coughing. Like a LAM, gas grenades can be attached to any surface.

GUIDED EXPLOSIVE PROJECTILE (GEP) GUN

The GEP gun is a relatively recent invention in the field of armaments: a
portable, shoulder-mounted launcher that can fire rockets and laser guide them
to their target with pinpoint accuracy. While suitable for high-threat combat
situations, it can be bulky for those agents who have not grown familiar with
it.

HAZMAT SUIT

A standard hazardous materials suit that protects against a full range of
environmental hazards including radiation, fire, biochemical toxins,
electricity, and EMP. Hazmat suits contain an integrated bacterial oxygen
scrubber that degrades over time and thus should not be reused.

LIGHT ANTI-TANK WEAPON (LAW)

The LAW provides cheap, dependable anti-armor capability in the form of an
integrated one-shot rocket and delivery system, though at the expense of any
laser guidance. Like other heavy weapons, the LAW can slow agents who have not
trained with it extensively.

LIGHTWEIGHT ATTACK MUNITIONS (LAM)

A multi-functional explosive with electronic priming system that can either be
thrown or attached to any surface with its polyhesive backing and used as a
proximity mine.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE SC093-BLUE> Disarming a proximity device should only be
attempted with the proper demolitions training. Trust me on this. -- Sam Carter
<END NOTE>

LIQUOR

The label is torn off, but it looks like some of the good stuff.

LOCKPICK

A disposable lockpick. The tension wrench is steel, but appropriate needles are
formed from fast congealing polymers.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE AJ006-BLACK> Here's what they don't tell you: despite the
product literature, you can use a standard lockpick to bypass all but the most
high-class nanolocks. -- Alex Jacobson <END NOTE>

MEDKIT

A first-aid kit.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE JR095-VIOLET> The nanomachines of an augmented agent will
automatically metabolize the contents of a medkit to efficiently heal damaged
areas. An agent with medical training could greatly expedite this process. --
Jaime Reyes <END NOTE>
Use to heal critical body parts, or use on character screen to direct healing at
a certain body part.

MULTITOOL

A disposable electronics tool. By using electromagnetic resonance detection and
frequency modulation to dynamically alter the flow of current through a circuit,
skilled agents can use the multitool to manipulate code locks, cameras, autogun
turrets, alarms, or other security systems.

MINI-CROSSBOW

The mini-crossbow was specifically developed for espionage work, and accepts a
range of dart types (normal, tranquilizer, or flare) that can be changed
depending upon the mission requirements.

NANOKEY RING

A nanokey ring can read and store the two-dimensional molecular patterns from
different nanokeys, and then recreate those patterns on demand.

PEPPER GUN

The pepper gun will accept a number of commercially available riot control
agents in cartridge form and disperse them as a fine aerosol mist that can cause
blindness or blistering at short-range.

PISTOL

A standard 10mm pistol.

PLASMA RIFLE

An experimental weapon that is currently being produced as a series of one-off
prototypes, the plasma gun superheats slugs of magnetically-doped plastic and
accelerates the resulting gas-liquid mix using an array of linear magnets. The
resulting plasma stream is deadly when used against slow-moving targets.

PS20

The PS20 is a disposable, plasma-based weapon developed by an unknown security
organization as a next generation stealth pistol. Unfortunately, the necessity
of maintaining a small physical profile restricts the weapon to a single shot.
Despite its limited functionality, the PS20 can be lethal at close range.

REBREATHER

A disposable chemical scrubber that can extract oxygen from water during brief
submerged operations.

RIOT PROD

The riot prod has been extensively used by security forces who wish to keep what
remains of the crumbling peace and have found the prod to be a valuable tool.
Its short range tetanizing effect is most effective when applied to the torso or
when the subject is taken by surprise.

SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN

The sawed-off, pump-action shotgun features a truncated barrel resulting in a
wide spread at close range and will accept either buckshot or sabot shells.

SCRAMBLE GRENADE
The detonation of a GUARDIAN scramble grenade broadcasts a short-range,
polymorphic broadband assault on the command frequencies used by almost all bots
manufactured since 2028. The ensuing electronic storm causes bots within its
radius of effect to indiscriminately attack other bots until command control can
be re-established. Like a LAM, scramble grenades can be attached to any surface.

SNIPER RIFLE

The military sniper rifle is the superior tool for the interdiction of long-
range targets. When coupled with the proven 30.06 round, a marksman can achieve
tight groupings at better than 1 MOA (minute of angle) depending on
environmental conditions.

SODA

The can is blank except for the phrase "PRODUCT PLACEMENT HERE." It is unclear
whether this is a name or an invitation.

SOY FOOD

Fine print: "Seasoned with nanoscale generators, this TSP (textured soy protein)
not only tastes good but also self-heats when its package is opened."

STEALTH PISTOL

The stealth pistol is a variant of the standard 10mm pistol with a larger clip
and integrated silencer designed for wet work at very close ranges.

SWORD

A rather nasty-looking sword.

TECH GOGGLES

Tech goggles are used by many special ops forces throughout the world under a
number of different brand names, but they all provide some form of portable
light amplification in a disposable package.

THERMOPTIC CAMO

Integrating woven fiber-optics and an advanced computing system, thermoptic camo
can render an agent invisible to both humans and bots by dynamically refracting
light and radar waves; however, the high power drain makes it impractical for
more that short-term use, after which the circuitry is fused and it becomes
useless.

THROWING KNIVES

A favorite weapon of assassins in the Far East for centuries, throwing knives
can be deadly when wielded by a master but are more generally used when it
becomes desirable to send a message. The message is usually "Your death is
coming on swift feet."

WEAPON MODIFICATIONS

Drag over weapon to upgrade. Weapons highlighted in GREEN can be upgraded with
this mod.

Accuracy
When clamped to the frame of most projectile weapons, a harmonic balancer will
dampen the vertical motion produced by firing a projectile, resulting in
increased accuracy.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE SC108-BLUE> Almost any weapon that has a significant
amount of vibration can be modified with a balancer; I've even seen it work with
the mini-crossbow and a prototype plasma gun. -- Sam Carter <END NOTE>

Clip
An extended magazine that increases clip capacity beyond the factory default.

Laser
A laser targeting dot eliminates any inaccuracy resulting from the inability to
visually gauge a projectile's point of impact.

Range
By lubricating the firing path with synthetic synovial fluid, the drag on fired
projectiles is greatly reduced with a consequent increase in range.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE SC111-BLUE> Coating the primary valve system of a
flamethrower or plasma gun in synovial lubricant and then over-pressuring the
delivery system will also result in an increase in range. Little trick I learned
during field testing. -- Sam Carter <END NOTE>

Recoil
A stock cushioned with polycellular shock absorbing material will significantly
reduce perceived recoil.

Reload
A speed loader greatly decreases the time required to reload a weapon.

Scope
A telescopic scope attachment provides zoom capability and increases accuracy
against distant targets.

Silencer
A silencer will muffle the muzzle crack caused by rapidly expanding gases left
in the wake of a bullet leaving the gun barrel.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE SC108-BLUE> Obviously, a silencer is only effective with
firearms. -- Sam Carter <END NOTE>

WINE

A nice bottle of wine.

ZYME VIAL

A vial of zyme, brewed up in some basement lab.

HEALTH

ARMS

Obviously damage to the arm is of concern in any combat situation as it has a
direct effect on the agent's ability to utilize a variety of weapons. Losing the
use of one arm will certainly lower the agent's combat efficiency, while the
loss of both arms will render it nearly impossible for an agent to present even
a nominal threat to most hostiles.

Light Wounds: Slightly decreased accuracy.
Medium Wounds: Moderately decreased accuracy.
Major Wounds: Significantly decreased accuracy.

HEAD

Head wounds are fatal in the vast majority of threat scenarios; however, in
those cases where death is not instantaneous, agents will often find that head
injuries impair vision and aim. Care should be taken to heal such injuries as
quickly as possible or death may result.

Light Wounds: Slightly decreased accuracy.
Medium Wounds: Wavering vision.
Heavy Wounds: Death.

LEGS

Injuries to the leg will result in drastically diminished mobility. If an agent
in hostile territory is unfortunate enough to lose the use of both legs but
still remain otherwise viable, they are ordered to execute UNATCO Special
Operations Order 99009 (Self-Termination).

Light Wounds: Slightly impaired movement.
Medium Wounds: Moderately impaired movement.
Heavy Wounds: Significantly impaired movement.

TORSO

The torso is by far the portion of the human anatomy able to absorb the most
damage, but it is also the easiest to target in close quarters combat. As
progressively more damage is inflicted to the torso, agents may find their
movements impaired and eventually bleed to death even if a mortal blow to a
vital organ is not suffered.

Light Wounds: Slightly impaired movement.
Medium Wounds: Significantly impaired movement.
Major Wounds: Death.

SYNTHETIC HEART

This synthetic heart circulates not only blood but a steady concentration of
mechanochemical power cells, smart phagocytes, and liposomes containing prefab
diamondoid machine parts, resulting in upgraded performance for all installed
augmentations.
<UNATCO OPS FILE NOTE JR133-VIOLET> However, this will not enhance any
augmentation past its maximum upgrade level. -- Jaime Reyes <END NOTE>
NO UPGRADES

TARGETING

Image-scaling and recognition provided by multiplexing the optic nerve with
doped polyacetylene "quantum wires" not only increases accuracy, but also
delivers limited situational info about a target.

Tech one: Slight increase in accuracy and general target information.
Tech two: Additional increase in accuracy and more target information.
