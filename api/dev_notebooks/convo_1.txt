BARTENDER
Many bargains at the Old China Hand. Everything eight credits.

JC DENTON
Heard the name Tracer Tong?

BARTENDER
Tong, yes... friend of the Luminous Path Triad. And, by extension, enemy of the
Red Arrow.

JC DENTON
What's his reputation... among the locals?

BARTENDER
Shrewd, but fair. Very well-connected. You want to buy... biomechanical
augmentation?

JC DENTON
Just curious.
Is there a lot of crime in Hong Kong?

BARTENDER
Much more than before, yes. Now it's very easy for the smugglers.

JC DENTON
What kind of smugglers?

BARTENDER
Slaves, heroin, biotech...

JC DENTON
Is there really a slave-trade?

BARTENDER
Oh, sure. Visit the Lucky Money underneath Wan Chai, the Red Arrow
headquarters... All of their girls, they are kidnapped in Thailand or the
Philippines. Not a pretty business.

JC DENTON
What sort of biotech smuggling goes on?

BARTENDER
Mostly VersaLife, the Golden Triangle of biotech.

JC DENTON
Why would a multinational corporation smuggle their products on sampans?

BARTENDER
Import restrictions in many places -- the United States, European countries...

JC DENTON
On what?

BARTENDER
Certain genetic advances... laboratory organisms. Also, tiny computers in your
tissue.

JC DENTON
What's VersaLife trying to develop?

BARTENDER
Everything. The Second Men.

JC DENTON
The Second Men?

BARTENDER
English author. Olaf Stapledon. You have not read?

JC DENTON
Afraid not.

BARTENDER
Last and First Men. History of 19 species of human beings. I cannot believe you
do not know this book.

JC DENTON
I'm not big into books.
Do you know of a Maggie Chow?

BARTENDER
Maggie Chow. A bad character. Before, she was an actress. Now she is everywhere
in Hong Kong politics. They say that she is a spy.

JC DENTON
Who does she spy for?

BARTENDER
No one knows. Somebody paid a lot of money once, and one of the Red Arrows ended
up floating in the canal. Dangerous to talk about.
